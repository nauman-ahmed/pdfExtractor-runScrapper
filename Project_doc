## ðŸš€ FastAPI Application Setup Guide for Windows

Follow the steps below to set up and run the FastAPI application on your Windows machine.

---

### ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
  Make sure Python is installed. You can check by running:
  ```
  python --version
  ```

- If Python is not installed:  
  Download and install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.  
  âœ… Make sure to check the "Add Python to PATH" option during installation.

---

### ðŸ›  Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Clone or Download the Project

If the project is hosted on GitHub, you can clone it using:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

Or simply download and extract the `.zip` file of the project.

---

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```
python -m venv venv
```

This will create a folder named `venv` containing your virtual environment.

---

#### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Youâ€™ll see `(venv)` in the terminal prompt, which means the environment is active.

---

#### 4. Upgrade pip (optional but recommended)

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

#### 5. Install Project Dependencies

Make sure a `requirements.txt` file is present in the project folder. Then run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install FastAPI and any other required packages.

---

#### 6. Run the FastAPI Application

If your FastAPI app is in a file named `main.py`, you can run:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

- `main`: the Python file without `.py` extension
- `app`: the FastAPI instance inside the file

---

### âœ… Access the App

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:

- API Root: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Interactive Docs (Swagger): http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- Alternative Docs (ReDoc): http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

---

### ðŸ§¹ Optional: Deactivate Virtual Environment

When done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply typing:

```
deactivate
```
