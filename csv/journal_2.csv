An enduring myth is of entrepreneurship as 
the
 means to the goal of economic growth. With a growing realization that perpetual economic growth and firm growth are not sustainable and violate the planet's biophysical limits, entrepreneurship should focus on contributing to a post-growth society. However, in this paper, we argue that the problems with this are twofold: one, the notions of a post-growth society are not at present compatible with entrepreneurship, and two, such an orientation continues to consider entrepreneurship as a means to a goal - in other words as a tool to fix the problems caused by excessive economic growth. In this light, we call for a de-emphasis on entrepreneurship as a means to economic growth and for more research and policies towards business venturing as a goal. Such a reorientation may also provide a basis for conceptualizing entrepreneurship in a post-growth society.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,2,The focus on post-growth society and de-emphasizing entrepreneurship's role in economic growth does not offer practical value for European early-stage ventures.

Healthcare entrepreneurship is of growing interest, but the area of research is not well defined and is disparate across disciplines. We take an integrative approach to examine the similarities and differences between the literature for the two parent domains (healthcare management and entrepreneurship). We present findings from an interdisciplinary four-phase 
Delphi study
 and propose a new framework to guide future research. Our proposed healthcare entrepreneurship framework not only reflects variations in key factors, such as actors, activities, processes and outcomes within the parent disciplines, but also suggests gaps, connections and future opportunities for research.
Actionable summary and highlights
Since COVID-19, there has been an influx of healthcare entrepreneurial ventures, but, within a volatile market, mixed success. We find that healthcare entrepreneurship is different from work in healthcare or entrepreneurship alone. For healthcare entrepreneurs to achieve their targeted health outcomes as well as their operational and profitability outcomes, all stakeholders need to work together. For the clinician-turned-entrepreneur and the serial entrepreneur now in healthcare, we provide three actionable insights to address some of the practical challenges in healthcare entrepreneurship.
1.
We advise that venture teams include individuals from both entrepreneurship and healthcare backgrounds to shorten the learning curve, particularly as they develop the evidence base for the offering. Contacting entrepreneurship accelerators or university tech transfer and commercialization offices for which one may have had previous affiliations can be one approach to securing such team members.
2.
Healthcare entrepreneurs should consider how to include end-user or patient participation to create new healthcare solutions. Working with relevant patient advocacy groups can be one approach and may help to increase the relevance and patient-centeredness of the solution.
3.
Healthcare entrepreneurs may need to develop new business models and revenue streams. While healthcare is a human right, it requires financing to sustain offerings. One may strengthen one's “business and calling” 
mindset
 via joining healthcare entrepreneurship organizations for medical professionals, accelerators, and other local programs that support such entrepreneurial engagement in healthcare.
In addition to these insights for healthcare entrepreneurs, we include practical insights for other key actors. Corporations may incentivize partnerships that normalize co-produced innovations. Venture capitalists might develop novel funding mechanisms linked to non-traditional outcomes. Non-profit organizations can serve as interdisciplinary conveners to raise awareness of healthcare entrepreneurship needs. Policy makers might consider ways to create business environments with competitive, yet reasonable, cost and pricing structures.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,9,"The framework proposed for healthcare entrepreneurship offers actionable insights and guidance for entrepreneurs, clinicians, venture teams, and other stakeholders, making it highly relevant and practical for the European early-stage ventures and startups."

Micro-acquisition marketplaces are a recent phenomenon in the world of entrepreneurship that facilitate the matching of buyers and sellers of relatively small-scale startups or pre-startup projects. Unlike traditional acquisitions, in micro-acquisition markets, sellers typically decide on the timing and offset an initial asking price for the deal. However, cognitive biases are likely to interfere with these decisions and lead to suboptimal decisions that prevent efficient matching. We argue that the age of a project at the time of listing can act as a proxy for the time and effort that has been spent by the entrepreneur to develop the project. Building on effort justification and 
cognitive dissonance theories
, we argue that there is a curvilinear relationship between project age and price; and that this relationship is moderated by the level of revenue achieved by the project at the time of listing. Using data from 
Acquire.com

Sometimes, entrepreneurial action is driven by necessity. Whether global pandemics, climate change, or the oxygen system failure in Apollo 13, time-constrained and high-stakes decisions increasingly confront entrepreneurs and managers. Yet, our literature tends to favor intendedly rational and practiced approaches to entrepreneurial action in the face of perceived uncertainty. This study views entrepreneurial action from the other side of the mirror – imposed opportunities (not created), high time pressure, and limited resources (no trove access to resources and an inability to leverage contingencies). Using a mixed-methods approach and drawing upon data from the empirical setting of professional chefs and discourse from popular media, we explore these unique forms of entrepreneurial action through the lens of MacGyvering – a term developed from a 1980's hit television show where seemingly impossible odds and idiosyncratic challenges are routinely overcome. Our findings suggest that MacGyvering does not map neatly onto any single established concept of entrepreneurial action. Instead, it integrates some aspects of effectuation, causation, bricolage, and improvisation while explicitly adapting and eschewing others. Our insights can help entrepreneurs and managers act expeditiously to create new value in the face of environmental turbulence.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,8,"The exploration of entrepreneurial action driven by necessity, time pressure, and limited resources provides valuable insights for startups facing challenging environmental turbulence, offering alternative perspectives on entrepreneurial approaches."

How to deal with grand challenges and the crisis of knowledge production and their implications for entrepreneurial research and practice is a topic of growing interest. In this paper we argue that we need to rethink who is involved in entrepreneurship research and how that research is conducted and communicated. This begins by moving beyond the traditional ostensible objective separation of the ‘researcher’ from the ‘research subject’ to adopt a posthuman and post-qualitative inquiry perspective that questions the dominant position of the human subject and challenges the humanistic belief in the essential, conscious and intentional human as the primary source of agency. As such, it adopts a process ontology, stresses hybridity and difference and encourages experimentation. This requires us to become ‘bad researchers’, undertaking subversive research that goes beyond the oppositions of quantitative/qualitative and foundationalist/non-foundationalist. In this we take the ‘fool’ (jester, trickster) as our guide. Historically associated with inversion, usurping authority and putting down the mighty the fool is a liminal character who has the duty to ask all those questions that no one else dares to ask. The paper concludes with suggestions as to how this may inform a re-newed entrepreneurship for the crisis-laden twenty first century.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,2,The abstract focuses more on theoretical concepts and does not provide practical value or impact for early-stage ventures.

Ten years after the enactment of the Italian Start-up Act, it is interesting to assess its impact and evaluate whether and to what extent it succeeds in bringing innovations to the market and fosters local development in Italy.

Entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) that support entrepreneurship are seen as tightly spatially bound, top-down systems. They are exogenous to entrepreneurs but endogenous to the jurisdiction's policymakers and other powerful stakeholders. Taking a knowledge spillover theory approach, this paper offers a new perspective on these systems that better fits the globalized, digitalized, and increasingly geographically unbounded realities of entrepreneurship. Resources and knowledge increasingly harbor synergies across, not just within, the spatial bounds of EEs. We describe geographically unbounded EEs (UEEs) as border-spanning, entrepreneur-centered, and hybrid or digital community-centered. These structures support entrepreneurs in assembling knowledge and resources across multiple geographically bounded EEs. We identify four interrelated dimensions of UEEs, namely, resources provided, inclusiveness, spread of activities, and governance, and show how each varies among geographically bounded EEs. The key insight of our study is that UEEs create conditions where the EE becomes increasingly endogenous to the entrepreneur. Such a shift prompts new theoretical questions about entrepreneurial capabilities and the role of policy.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,6,"The abstract introduces a new perspective on entrepreneurial ecosystems that can be beneficial for start-ups, but lacks specific actionable insights for early-stage ventures."

Accelerators are gaining popularity in the entrepreneurship ecosystem for accelerating new ventures by providing benefits such as learning, sorting, and signaling. However, theoretical tension exists about whether these benefits are contingent on quality of institutions. The institutional-void view suggests that accelerator benefits are more pronounced in countries with weak institutions, while the institutional-support view posits the importance of strong institutions for realizing the benefits of accelerators. In this study, we theorize and test the moderating role of institutions in assessing the impact of accelerators on new venture performance using a generalized difference-indifferences technique on a worldwide accelerator database. At the baseline, the findings are consistent with previous literature, which shows a positive impact of accelerators on new ventures performance. More importantly, the key insight of our study is that the positive impact of accelerators is higher in countries with stronger institutions, thus favoring the institutional-support view.

The paper bridges the contours of neuroscience and entrepreneurship to unveil the neuronal path to transfigure entrepreneur-level capabilities into enterprise-level capabilities without holding a priori assumptions about serendipity or application of the aggregation principle. It reveals that neural mechanisms through which efforts of entrepreneurs are aggregated and exploited at the enterprise level—mirror neuron system and neuroplasticity—do not represent a fortuity, but conscious endeavors on the parts of both entrepreneurs and the enterprise to bridge these distances. In doing so, this paper explains how the brains of various entrepreneurial actors can be trained like muscles, and how they can achieve bio-behavioral synchrony to facilitate such neurochemical changes in their brain wiring that induce cognitive, affective, and conative aspects of opportunity identification, opportunity exploitation, and successful reconfiguration, which are essential for an entrepreneurial brain. Moreover, the paper demonstrates how mirror neuron system can become the gateway to neuroplasticity and how this cross-modal matching can assist entrepreneurial actors in developing their capabilities. The conceptual framework proposed explains how entrepreneurial actors, and consequently, the enterprise, can move towards a more plastic mode of operation, one that helps disrupt the brain's homeostasis to achieve enterprise plasticity, and ultimately develop robust enterprise-level capabilities.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,5,"The integration of neuroscience and entrepreneurship is innovative and offers a unique perspective on entrepreneurial capabilities.

When experiencing the effects of narrative transportation, individuals are “transported” into the story and begin to accept the narrative world as created by the story in lieu of personal knowledge, experiences, or real-world facts. In an entrepreneurship context, we posit that if investors are narratively transported through a familiar pitch narrative, they may envisage a favorable outcome of what is pitched and adapt the opportunity in their minds with the result of, ultimately, committing resources. The findings from our study of investors who watched and reported on multiple pitches suggest that cognitive processes induced by narrative transportation explain the relationship between familiarity and entrepreneurial opportunity adaptation, which—in turn—increase the likelihood of angels' resource commitment. The key insight of our study reveals that when the investors are mentally transported into the story contained within a pitch narrative, they will be more likely to adapt the opportunity and more likely to commit their resources.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,8,"The study offers valuable insights on how entrepreneurs can persuade angel investors through narrative transportation theory, potentially influencing resource commitment."

Although the entrepreneurship literature has extensively examined the mental health of entrepreneurs, there has been a notable lack of focus on entrepreneurs’ physical health. This exploratory study aims at understanding the importance of physical health issues for venture distress, in comparison to other issues, such as mental health concerns. Furthermore, it investigates the extent to which entrepreneurs faced with physical health issues are more or less likely to (in)voluntarily exit their ventures. Particularly, we examine 1752 entrepreneurs in distressed ventures in the Flemish region of Belgium over the period 2016–2019. We find that physical health issues are linked to venture distress, and entrepreneurs in distressed ventures tend to attribute venture distress more to physical rather than mental health issues. Furthermore, entrepreneurs dealing with physical health issues are much more likely to exit their ventures, often involuntarily, rather than continuing to manage them. This research provides important contributions to both the entrepreneurial health and entrepreneurial exit literatures, and practical implications for entrepreneurs, support providers and public policymakers.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,6,"The study sheds light on the link between physical health issues and venture distress, offering practical implications for entrepreneurs and policymakers."

Using an exploratory case study of the energy industry we provide evidence that industry incumbents are one potential solution to help alleviate the market coordination problem inherent to financing social ventures. As a going concern, we find that corporate investors exhibit temporal benevolence and can provide investment horizons necessary for solutions to be developed and diffused.

Each of the four types will approach retirement differently, depending on their experience as an entrepreneur and factors external to business such as financial and family circumstances.

This article extends the entrepreneurship literature by presenting a multispecies lens that attends to the rights, agency, and welfare of nonhumans in the ecological and climate change crises. It responds to calls for rethinking entrepreneurship beyond anthropocentrism, integrating insights from multispecies studies and philosophical ethology. The multispecies lens framework amalgamates humans and nonhumans as equal partners in entrepreneurial endeavors. Based on seven years of field research, including over 200 interviews, participant observation, and archival data, the article uses meta-ethnographic analysis to synthesize findings from four related multispecies studies and develop a line-of-argument analysis. Three themes showcase how multispecies relations can be reconciled in theory and practice: 1) community engagement and environmental education, 2) the interdependency of species through One Welfare, and 3) organizing for intrinsic value over profit. These themes shape the multispecies lens in entrepreneurship framework, offering a foundation for scholars and practitioners to consider nonhumans as

We find that entrepreneurship in space is currently in a phase overcoming many of the previously voiced obstacles, embracing the opportunities that space offers beyond catering to government agencies as main clients. We call this contemporary period for space Transition Space, which is situated between Old government-driven and venture-driven New Space.

Outliers in entrepreneurship are founders who are markedly different—both quantitatively and qualitatively—relative to the “normal” population. We use a power law perspective to hypothesize that, in order for new ventures to persist, founders with outlier endowments are more likely to have novel expectations about the opportunities they pursue and greater variation in the execution methods they employ, while normal founders are more likely to have much lower expectations and engage in a manner that is confined to fit within the smaller scope of explicit market demand. We leverage data from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics II, a longitudinal 
representative sample
 of 1214 nascent entrepreneurs organizing resources in preparation for startup, and employ 
fuzzy set
 qualitative comparative analysis to investigate our hypothesized relationships. In support, the results suggest that founders need to stay in their lane for their ventures to persist: whereas outlier founders have the option to successfully pursue more ambitious opportunities—those that are innovative, growth-oriented, and international focused—normal founders are primarily resigned to niche opportunities. Even more interesting, ventures are much less likely to persist when there is a misalignment between endowments, expectations, and engagement (i.e., when outlier founders pursue niche opportunities and normal founders pursue aspirational opportunities).

Withdrawn IPOs remain an empirically underexplored topic. Between 1997 and 2021, approximately 1 in 6 IPOs attempted on the NASDAQ and NYSE were withdrawn, collectively amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized growth capital. For entrepreneurial ventures, the strategic consequences of the withdrawal decision are severe. My findings indicate that withdrawn IPOs face a considerable delay in subsequent attempts to enter public markets, alongside a substantial reduction in total offer proceeds. Crucially, the JOBS Act in 2012 marks a pivotal inflection in the public markets, significantly reducing the incidence of IPO withdrawals and altering the course of financing strategies for emerging growth companies. I argue that an integrated recognition of both withdrawal activity and the regulatory dynamics of the JOBS Act is crucial for a complete understanding of the evolving IPO landscape.

Entrepreneurial ecosystem
 (EE) leadership is the orchestration of multiple groups to influence the effectiveness of an EE. Although singular leaders can influence ecosystems, EE leadership rarely works alone. EE leaders often function in interconnected groups from different organizations and are in the unique position of simultaneously leading their organizations (leadership within EEs) while providing leadership to the ecosystem itself (leadership of EEs). However, it is not clear how EE leadership groups work 
independently
 on their respective goals and 
interdependently
 on the superordinate goal of coordinating effective EEs. To address the lack of theory to explain this inherent characteristic of ecosystems, we adapt insights from group dynamics to develop a multi-level model of EEs as multiteam systems.

Christopher=Crawford: GCrawford@UT.edu; Harry=Joo: yjoo01@udayton.edu; Herman=Aguinis: haguinis@gwu.edu,"Abstract
A fundamental discovery in entrepreneurship is that firm outcomes do not follow a symmetrical 
Gaussian
 curve. Instead, most are heavily right-skewed distributions in which a few extreme outliers (e.g., rock star firms like Airbnb, Tesla, and Uber) account for a disproportionate amount of the output. Although past research usually described outcome distributions as shaped following the power law, our study asks the following question: 
What other less extreme distributions of generalizable firm outcomes exist in entrepreneurship?
 Our investigation leverages four representative datasets from the U.S., Europe, and Australia, comprising 32 samples with about 22,000 ventures. We implemented a precise data-analytic approach that compares each sample (i.e., empirical distribution) against multiple theoretical distribution shapes to identify the best fit. Results showed that, across nearly all samples, the pure power law was not the dominant distribution. Instead, the annual revenue distribution is shaped as a power law with an exponential cutoff, and the number of employees distribution is shaped lognormally. Combined, these suggest the existence of top-down limitations on the highest performing firms. Accordingly, we offer an agenda for future research focused on (a) identifying and releasing systemic constraints, (b) examining and falsifying the underlying generative mechanisms that cause the emergence of heavy-tailed distributions and the outliers therein, and (c) conducting multi-level, mixed-method studies to investigate how micro-level interactions aggregate into macro-level heavy-tailed distributions.

Entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) are complex social systems dependent on connectivity and shared understanding between diverse actors. An often used, albeit oversimplified view, implies that diverse actors connect, collaborate and contribute to the EE in an almost frictionless way. However, this perspective overlooks the need for deeper forms of communication that can shift actors' perceptions, goals and motivations to trigger meaningful change. Recent research has highlighted the role of conversations, narratives and stories in developing (informal) institutions and shared understandings. What is missing from this discussion, however, are non-verbal forms of communication, which enable interpretation, support meaning-making and help implementation. This paper draws on communicative institutionalism theory and empirical observations from a larger participatory action research project. We discuss how visuals support richer interpretation of ambiguities, different perspectives and collaborative sensemaking. Images act as boundary objects enabling creative associations, revealing assumptions and catalysing explorative dialogue through inherent ambiguity. Representing complex concepts visually facilitates participant engagement over time. The co-creative process of iterative illustration also captures shared meaning as it emerges. Implications highlight visuals’ potential for fostering future-oriented dialogue, reflective practice and embodied institutions fundamental for EEs.

The characterization of entrepreneurs as scientists (EaS) has become increasingly popular among management scholars because it fits neatly with existing theories of 
entrepreneurial action
 grounded in the assumption that entrepreneurs form and test beliefs in an intendedly rational fashion, under conditions of uncertainty, while continually seeking to obtain and process new information. Recent scholarship breathes new life into the EaS paradigm by proposing a framework that builds upon pragmatism in developing a microfoundational perspective concerning causally inferential action and rationality-based heuristics. Yet, the drift towards EaS is not without controversy. Business venturing is rarely analyzable through the lens of natural laws and orderly structures. Moreover, uncertainty is not the only knowledge problem (KP) that entrepreneurs confront. As such, EaS may be ineffective in bringing resolution to these other challenging KPs – ambiguity, complexity, and equivocality – especially when entrepreneurs are entertaining decisions to pivot or persist. In this sense, our work underscores the importance of EaS while also asserting the need for clear boundary conditions.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,5,"While the discussion on the characterization of entrepreneurs as scientists is interesting, the abstract does not provide clear practical value or impact for early-stage ventures or startups in Europe."

The case for repositioning

Notwithstanding, how a theory-praxis nexus results in first-person transformation remains underdeveloped. Accordingly, this paper advances 
interiority

Thus, we contribute to shifting the focus of learning from what we know, to how we know in a process of intellectual self-awareness.

A topic of growing interest in entrepreneurship research is how entrepreneurial ventures address grand challenges. This literature, we argue, tends to produce a panacea myth by suggesting that entrepreneurship is the universal remedy for existing social and environmental ills. Starting from the claim that the persuasive power or ‘stickiness’ of the panacea myth depends not only on what it explicitly says (in terms of ideas and beliefs) but also on what it leaves out, we suggest that the exclusion of explicitly political and holistic explanations of grand challenges such as Iris Marion Young's theory of structural injustice, which we use as an illustrative example, precipitates a ‘constitutive absence’ whose mythic function is to sanitize the image of entrepreneurship as the preferred solution to grand challenges. In an effort to denaturalize the panacea myth, we first identify three ‘figures of thought’ – coined ‘extrapolation fallacy,’ ‘political agnosticism,’ and ‘positive acculturation’ – that define the content of the panacea myth while simultaneously excluding theoretical concepts and frameworks, such as structural injustice, that conceptualize grand challenges as structural, multidetermined, and inherently political problems that are not necessarily amenable to stand-alone 
entrepreneurial approaches
 and solutions. Second, to loosen the grip of the panacea myth, we suggest rethinking entrepreneurship research in terms of who is involved, what methods are used, and how we talk about it. Taken together, these tactics create an opening in entrepreneurship research for a more complexity-sensitive and political understanding of grand challenges that cultivates a more humble and realistic depiction of entrepreneurship's problem-solving capacity.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,8,"The paper challenges the panacea myth surrounding entrepreneurship as the solution to grand challenges.

The idea of The Entrepreneurial State, a state that acts as an entrepreneur, creating and shaping markets to solve certain missions, has captured the eye of the public and of scholars. Yet, a number of scholars have voiced critique of The Entrepreneurial State Paradigm, arguing that it leads to policy failure. But simultaneously, other scholars argue that policy failures stem from interpretation and poor implementation, rather than core ideas in The Entrepreneurial State, such as mission-oriented policies. In this paper, I seek to clarify this debate. I argue that the growing reports of mission-oriented policy failures are due to three factors nested in The Entrepreneurial State Paradigm. They are 1) Disregard of the role of private entrepreneurship; 2) Encouraging policy makers to disregard limits to government action, and 3) Extrapolating grand policies from limited results. Thus, I argue that registered policy failures do not stem merely from bad policy making or incorrect interpretations of The Entrepreneurial State Paradigm. They stem directly from this paradigm. Consequently, I argue that scholars and policy makers should move away from The Entrepreneurial State and instead focus on the enabling role of the state.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,7,The paper clarifies the debate on The Entrepreneurial State Paradigm and argues for a shift in focus towards the enabling role of the state.

Advice abounds on how to implement large-scale social change, much of which emphasizes a simplistic

, led by a heroic central actor. Rigorous 
case studies
 have shown that social change is far more complex: it is a reciprocal, iterative, and adaptive process, with multiple stakeholders who work backstage in networked, committed teams. Despite this, the myth of the social entrepreneur as a transformative change maker capable of scaling innovations to a societal level, still holds sway over social innovation support programmes and business school curricula. Using illustrative examples of successful efforts of large-scale social change across three of the most pressing international social challenges: access to medicines, the integration of migrant populations, and reorganizing social care models, we illustrate how conceptualizing social change as driven by iconic individuals is often counter-productive in terms of achieving impact at a societal level. Based on these analyses, we present five insights which illustrate how the mythology of social entrepreneurship and simplistic scaling concepts are often contrary to the practices employed within successful efforts to bring about social impact. Three counteracting principles for those leading, evaluating and funding innovative change efforts within complex systems are discussed and contrasted with the pervasive mythology of social entrepreneurship and linear scaling processes.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,7,"This abstract challenges the myth of the social entrepreneur and provides insights on achieving societal impact, which can be valuable for early-stage ventures."

An increasing number of popularly frequented, but lightly studied, entrepreneurial events such as farmer's markets, festivals, art walks, night markets, and other seasonal gatherings occur regularly as forms of community meetups worldwide. At these events, individuals strive to create and enhance their communities through a series of often loosely organized gatherings that combine art, entertainment, and entrepreneurial promise. These events are associated with small business owners or hobbyists that sell their wares to a location-based market often searching for goods and services viewed as at least somewhat unique from other mainstream offerings. These events are critical for entrepreneurs as they serve as a vehicle to expand their customer base, build awareness for their products and brands, and even test out new product offerings in their local markets. Building knowledge of these events and the entrepreneurs that fuel such gatherings provides an opportunity to bridge the gap between ‘what we know’ and ‘what we aspire to know’ about these common entrepreneurial activities.

Paola=Ometto: pometto@csusm.edu,"Abstract
Initial coin offering (ICO) is a Web-3 based financing method for ventures, which allows them to use digital assets (e.g., tokens) to raise capital. During an ICO, the entrepreneur has control on ownership; they can choose to issue a very small number of tokens which would allow them to keep “their skin in the game” and retain ownership, or issue all the tokens they hold, which would distribute ownership to investors and have a community-decentralized orientation. While previous literature has identified several factors of ICO success, they have not delved into the role of ownership in ICO success. In this study, we explore whether retaining or distributing ownership during an ICO is more beneficial for raising capital. We find a two-pronged explanation. When looking at ICOs maintaining a higher level of ownership, entrepreneurs are catering to corporate-market logic investors, and we see a U relationship where the optimal percentage in which the entrepreneurs show they have skin in the game at the same time as giving enough to investors. But then, there are ICOs distributing most of its ownership in which entrepreneurs are attracting community-oriented investors, and as such, the higher the distribution the higher the investment. We propose that this is related to how there are different investors audiences’ that will value different practices and ideals and choose differently on what types of projects to invest in. Our research elucidates this new funding source. Nonetheless, future research should investigate these exploratory findings.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,6,The study on initial coin offerings and ownership in ICO success could be valuable for startups looking into funding options and strategic decision-making.

The goal of the current article is to address systematic barriers that hamper modern research on Entrepreneurial Personality (EP). We provide conceptual clarity to the meaning of EP, which we conceptualize with the dimensions of innovativeness, risk-taking propensity, 
achievement orientation
, 
proactiveness
, 
locus of control
, self-efficacy, and 
autonomy

We also formalize two competing perspectives regarding EP's relations with relevant outcomes; the Pillar Conceptualization proposes that EP produces consistent relations with relevant outcomes, whereas the Wheel Conceptualization proposes that EP produces varying relations that depend on the specific phase of the entrepreneurial process. Then, we develop the Entrepreneurial Personality Scale (EPS) using five samples (total 
n
 = 1877), which include samples of general participants and samples of solely entrepreneurs. We show that the EPS produces appropriate 
psychometric
 and validity evidence across both types of samples, strongly supporting its use in future research. We also show that the EPS dimensions produce varying relations with relevant outcomes, which were determined by the phase of the entrepreneurial process – supporting the Wheel Conceptualization. Via these efforts, future researchers can investigate EP with greater confidence in their theoretical rationale and methodological soundness by applying the EPS. The Wheel Conceptualization is also a promising lens to understand EP moving forward, and a clear future direction for research is to integrate novel temporal theories and frameworks to add nuance to this perspective.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,8,"This abstract addresses systematic barriers in researching Entrepreneurial Personality, offering a scale and insights that can be beneficial for startups in understanding key traits."

This study contributes to new debates about how hybrid entrepreneurship is related to specific psychological well-being dimensions (job, life, and leisure time satisfaction). To address this issue, Ardianti, Obschonka, and Davidsson (2022; AOD) published first empirical results in 
JBVInsights
. They provide evidence for different effects on well-being, depending on how individuals have switched from or into hybrid entrepreneurship. By drawing on panel data from Germany, two studies are conducted. While study 1 replicates the original methodological approach, study 2 provides an extension by applying cross-model coefficient comparison tests. In study 1 we were able to replicate some of the original results presented by AOD. In contrast to the original study, we find that the switch from wage employment to hybrid entrepreneurship is negatively related to job and 
life satisfaction
. Also, while AOD show that a switch from hybrid entrepreneurship to full-time entrepreneurship relates significantly to job and

Entrepreneurship is the study of ordinary people doing extraordinary things: outliers in society, seeing and enacting new venture opportunities, while most others do not.

Entrepreneurs eventually face the inevitable in which they must exit their firms. Some choose the entrepreneurial exit path of selling to an unaffiliated individual or company. This type of exit can arise due to a variety of reasons, including life situations, strategic reasons, or other interests. The process of selling a small, privately held company, oftentimes facilitated by business intermediaries, typically begins with introducing the company to potential acquirers through confidential marketing that provides just enough information to pique interest while also preserving the anonymity of the entrepreneur or business. One important element included in the marketing of a business is the entrepreneur's reason to sell. Due to the potential 
information asymmetry
 present in the sale of privately-held businesses, this study proposes that the reason for sale, referred to in this study as the 
communicated exit purpose,
 sends varying signals to potential acquirers impacting the perception of the business opportunity and acquisition price at exit. Utilizing an archival dataset from a popular business-for-sale website, our analysis shows support that the price at exit is affected by the communicated entrepreneur's reason for exit.

In many academic circles, promotion and tenure decisions are often driven by the quality of the candidate's research portfolio. In entrepreneurship, as in other disciplines, we tend to judge the quality and impact of our research based on publication in a select few top journals. In our paper, we investigate the incorrect inferences that result from using Journal Impact Factor (JIF) and other rankings as proxies to assess an article's scholarly quality and impact. In doing so, we hope to better understand any discrepancies between journal quality as measured by these proxies and individual article citation rates within both top and non-top entrepreneurship journals. Our results, based upon the average number of citations, show roughly 61% of the top four journals being misidentified as high quality (Type 2 error) and 22% of the remaining journal articles being misidentified as not high quality (Type 1 error). We illustrate the variability within the top entrepreneurship journals that further reinforces the importance of evaluating each article based on its individual merits rather than relying solely on proxies of quality.

It is intuitively appealing and common in the literature to describe social ties as one large category that represents multiple constructs which have similar relations across operationalizations.

Drawing upon novel objective measures of network ties derived from analyses of entrepreneurs’ Gmail data, we offer an empirical assessment of subjective social ties relative to objective social ties. In examining how those assessments relate to multiple metrics of venture performance, we look at both subjective and objective measures. We find that objective network measures predict overall subjective (but not objective) venture performance at an average of

The utilisation of this ‘field of entrepreneurship’ concept, with a particular focus on field dynamics, serves as a pragmatic analytical unit, contributing to the broader discourse by balancing simplicity, accuracy, and generalisability.

Problem-oriented research is increasingly gaining currency in entrepreneurship research. In this article, we respond to the need for more action-based perspectives in entrepreneurship. By employing an inductive research design based on 
qualitative interviews
 and participant observations, we discuss empirical evidence about two alternative problem formulation processes in the context of start-up competitions. We find that entrepreneurs may perceive start-up competitions as ‘beauty contests’, with the consequence of overpromised expectations, misaligned goals, and underutilized use of resources. The beauty contest represents a traditional interpretation of start-up competitions because it concentrates mainly on impressions and misses addressing real problems that entrepreneurs 
face

An alternative model for a new breed of start-up competitions is represented by co-created problematization, which challenges conventional thinking with a joint role for entrepreneurs and academics.

The discourse of the twenty first century is increasingly a discourse of crisis – global warming,

Increasingly these ‘grand challenges’ pose complex environmental and social problems that present radical uncertainty regarding the consequences of current actions and encourage multiple conflicting evaluations. We argue in this paper that in response to this ‘new world’ of super-wicked problems and hyperobjects, there is a unique opportunity for entrepreneurship to take centre stage, given that the entrepreneurial context itself is extreme in terms of uncertainty, time pressures, cognitive load, emotional reactions, and social interactions. However, there is a danger that this opportunity may be compromised by ongoing debates over the status, coherence, identity and legitimacy of entrepreneurship as a discipline. Accordingly, we argue for more problem-oriented research in entrepreneurship, not as an additional focus of attention but as foundational to the nature of the discipline itself. This argument is based on a broader discussion of the nature of scientific disciplines as the increasingly specialised division of knowledge and challenges the drive to establish entrepreneurship as a theory-led scientific discipline in the traditional mode.

In recent years, the notion of a unicorn, a startup exceeding a premarket valuation of one billion USD, has become one of the most prominent concepts in the practical discourse of entrepreneurship.

Entrepreneurial alertness (EA) has attracted increasing attention in scholarly work, and a multitude of empirical studies have examined the antecedents and outcomes of entrepreneurial alertness. Although there is consistent evidence for significant associations, ambiguities exist concerning the directions and magnitude of the relationships. The purpose of this study is to meta-analytically assess the antecedents and outcomes of EA. A total of 125 empirical studies were analyzed with 597 effect sizes derived from 18 different constructs and a sample of 1,820,331 individuals. We advance understanding of the critical role of alertness in generating entrepreneurial outcomes, its antecedents, and the directions and magnitude of the associations. We also provide several directions for further theorizing the role of alertness in entrepreneurship.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,8,The meta-analysis on entrepreneurial alertness provides valuable insights for startups to understand the critical role of alertness in generating entrepreneurial outcomes.

This study draws on the linguistics literature, which recognizes the role of language attributes in shaping individual behaviour. We theorize that weak-future languages (e.g., Chinese), which create the perception that the future is closer temporally to the present than do strong-future languages (e.g., English), favour future-oriented behaviours such as investment in crowdfunding of entrepreneurial ventures. To test this thesis, we use a mixed-method approach, combining an original dataset of crowdfunding investments in 53 countries (Study 1) and a randomized experiment examining the investment behaviour of 77 bilingual (English-Chinese) students (Study 2). We find that natives of countries with weak-future languages engage more actively in crowdfunding of entrepreneurial ventures compared to individuals from countries with strong-future languages. We find that this effect dominates the stable effect of national culture. In other words, perceiving the future as closer means that the future assumes greater psychological importance for weak-future speakers and, therefore, they enact more future-oriented behaviours.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,6,The study on language attributes and crowdfunding investments offers interesting findings that could be relevant for startups seeking crowdfunding.

In particular, we identify entrepreneurial passion as one mediating mechanism through which entrepreneurs' loneliness influences business exit intentions. One time-lagged survey using a sample of entrepreneurs from the United Kingdom and an additional survey using a sample of Indonesian entrepreneurs show that high levels of entrepreneurs' loneliness increase their business exit intentions through reducing entrepreneurial passion.

Christopher=Crawford: GCrawford@UT.edu,"Abstract
Prior studies investigating new venture emergence and growth from a gender-based lens have consistently found that, on average, female-founded ventures underperform their male-founded counterparts. In this study, we draw from the power law perspective to suggest that these findings primarily originate from the way researchers treat the outliers, those observations far from the normal. We hypothesize that the best of the best (i.e., the Rock Star) founders and ventures of each gender will have equally stellar performance. Contrary to the majority of entrepreneurship studies that consider outliers as ‘‘problems’’ that must be removed or transformed, the power law perspective assumes that outliers are different, have differential effects by skewing distributions far to the right, and are likely the most interesting and influential cases in the population. We leverage semi-parametric methods on longitudinal data from a representative sample of nascent entrepreneurial ventures to demonstrate the gender effect on outlier vs. non-outlier categories. Our findings suggest that gender does, in fact, negatively affect non-outliers (i.e., “average” entrepreneurs), while having no impact on outliers. We show that compared to the majority of the population, those with outlier 
inputs
—resource endowments, expectations for future growth, and engagement—have a greater likelihood of achieving outlier

Going public not only provides access to capital, but it is also an important mechanism through which firms can obtain feedback on opportunities from a wider set of stakeholders and market participants. We develop this argument by examining how feedback from the Initial Public Offering (IPO) process in the form of underpricing influences a firm's subsequent investment decisions. Our results indicate that underpricing is associated with increases in investment spending in R&D and Capex post-IPO. Further, we find that at extreme levels of underpricing these shifts in investments have a detrimental effect on firm outcomes. Our work highlights that going public significantly alters the information environment and shapes the perceived opportunities of newly public firms in important ways. As such, the IPO and underpricing are not simply outcomes, but rather are important contributors to how firms allocate resources and pursue opportunities into the future.

Entrepreneurship is multifaceted and there is considerable acknowledgement of the relevance of human agency and individual behavior – since entrepreneurship has proven fundamentally personal. While entrepreneurial behaviors are traditionally aligned with high growth, start-up firms, an evolving body of research recognizes that entrepreneurial behaviors can manifest in non-traditional, ‘heterodox’ contexts. One such context is the 
Daigou
 phenomenon. Daigou translates to ‘buying on one's behalf’ – Daigou serve as important ‘middlemen’ – connecting Chinese customers with Western brands by deviating from accepted or orthodox standards or beliefs to exploit free-market networks and engage in cross-border exporting. Daigou, in the context of this research functions as a novel heterodox backdrop to probe manifestations of entrepreneurial behavior, thus identifying how entrepreneurial actors behave ‘entrepreneurially’ in heterodox settings. Our review of the literature delivers three meaningful contributions.

The present research aims to provide answers in the quest to identify the explanatory factors in the development stage of the product of academic spin-offs in the pre-seed phase of their ventures. This is based on various factors that play a role in the innovation process and the development of new products – including characteristics of the project, characteristics of the R&D work and business model development, previous freelance experience, networking, financing, and technology field. The empirical analysis of data from academic startup ventures enrolled in a large German startup support program – using 
structural equation modeling
 – revealed both direct and indirect statistically significant effects, showing that a large proportion of the selected variables can be employed to explain the development stage of the product. The findings indicate that the R&D work stage has a medium-sized effect, while business model development stage, the degree of networking, project feasibility, and previous freelance experience connected with the product all have small effects.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,7,"The research provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the development stage of academic startup ventures, offering practical implications for early-stage European startups."

This study explores the complexities of causes of success mentioned in entrepreneurs'

The data analyzed were gathered from 173 reflective interviews featuring entrepreneurs on the United States' National Public Radio, using machine learning techniques for semantic content analysis. The results show that entrepreneurs can adopt three strategic presentation narratives to explain success in entrepreneurship. Significantly different patterns emerge in the three strategic narrative configurations. First, “lucky charming” narratives reflect an ingratiation strategy, mentioning external and uncontrollable causes of success to increase the entrepreneurs’ likability for the audience. Second, “work striving” narratives use self-promotion strategies to push for recognition of accomplishments, efforts, and intellectual abilities. Third, “social connecting” narratives simultaneously make use of ingratiation and exemplification strategies, including capitalizing on the positive signals given by the 
social support
 attracted during their entrepreneurial journey. These three discourse patterns have implications for influencing reputation and driving business- and personal-related outcomes. The findings provide a better understanding of deliberate appearances by entrepreneurs in broadcast contexts and tools for nascent entrepreneurs to leverage their role models among those with acclaimed entrepreneurial success.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,8,"The study offers a comprehensive analysis of strategic presentation narratives in entrepreneurship, providing practical guidance for startups on influencing reputation and driving business outcomes."

What inspires new entrepreneurial theory? And, what should it be – new entrepreneurial phenomena, new and different scholarly voices, or something else? There is recent evidence that it is a ‘something else’ – something that may be interpreted as unusual-yet-too-familiar – where established voices are stretching fictional stories and language games to get to their preferred models and definitions. While diversity and extension of ideas is more than welcome in our field, perhaps what is even more important is that that emerges from a more diverse and stretched set of authors, pedigrees and schools of thought. So, what is there to do? First, we can show that this current approach is not working through example. Second, we can suggest how to be better inspired. Third, we can consider the commonalities in these examples to comment on what that means for progress in the field as it is, and then to suggest ways for improvement at the field level.

In creating innovative entrepreneurial opportunities, entrepreneurs are characterized by limited 
information processing capabilities
 and local search routines that are immanent to humans. Machine learning (ML) offers the opportunity to overcome these limitations while reshaping the innovation process. It is indisputable that ML alone cannot realize entrepreneurial opportunities, but that close collaboration with the human entrepreneur is required. While entrepreneurs usually act according to the principles of effectuation logic in situations of high uncertainty and according to the principles of causation logic in situations of risk, it remains unclear how co-creation with ML affects the entrepreneur's decision-making behavior. By contrasting the functionalities of four different 
ML paradigms
 with the principles of the two decision logics, it is shown that supervised ML supports causation logic, while unsupervised and reinforcement ML support effectuation logic in their approach. As a fourth, semi-supervised ML is classified somewhere between effectuation and causation.

The replication of meta-analyses is important for developing stable and accurate insights into entrepreneurship. To that end, we replicate key aspects of the meta-analysis conducted by Miao et al.

We expand the number of included samples from 27 in Miao et al. (2017) to 159. Overall, we find that the relationship between self-efficacy and success is small (ρ = 0.24) using guidelines from Cohen (1988); however, the relationship between ESE and at least partially financial measures of success was moderate, but larger in size (ρ = 0.44 vs. ρ = 0.31), than that estimated by Miao et al. (2017). We find that effect sizes vary widely depending on the type of success variable—with small to practically insignificant relations between self-efficacy and firm size as measured by the number of employees. In addition, we find stronger relations between ESE and success than generalized self-efficacy. Altogether we find that without properly accounting for the influence of the type of success variable, researchers might draw incorrect conclusions regarding the role of self-efficacy in entrepreneurial dynamics.

Entrepreneurs proactively envision and pursue change, embracing the potential destruction of the status quo to create value by solving meaningful problems. With that, entrepreneurs themselves are the very embodiment of heterodoxy: deviation from accepted or orthodox standards or beliefs. The tensions, paradoxes, and juxtapositions of ideas, people, and resources underpinning heterodox thinking can shed considerable light on the discovery, enactment, evaluation, and exploitation of the opportunities the entrepreneurs of today are pursuing. To achieve this, though, requires directly tackling the real-world heterodoxies entrepreneurs are currently grappling with and developing their ventures within. Advancing knowledge on these critical inputs to entrepreneurship, however, involves entrepreneurship scholars explicitly seeking out and probing what we call 
meaningful heterodoxies

Uncertainty has been and continues to be misunderstood, in the forms it can take, in its definitions, and in how it and its effects are modelled. That confusion is unhelpful for theorizing in general and, more specifically, it is detrimental for the study of entrepreneurship, given our field’s intimate if not existential connection with uncertainty.

Rationality is an elusive and increasingly debated concept in entrepreneurship research. We offer a novel conceptualization of rationality based on reasoning motivations.

By contrast, when the reasoning ignores an assessment of reality and accuracy in problem-solving and instead is deluded by psychological (e.g., hedonic) urges that prompt self-serving inferences, we categorize such decisions as motivationally irrational.

Uncertainty and resource scarcity are usually considered the hallmark of entrepreneurship.

 is considered a promising vehicle to stimulate and grow social economy enterprises, little is known about how impact investors are actually responding to sustain and grow social economy enterprises amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that impact investors sacrifice additional financial returns in pandemic-focused impact investments where they see the potential for attaining significantly higher than usual social impact by protecting hundreds of vulnerable social economy enterprises and beneficiaries amidst the pandemic. We also find that guarantees are introduced as an innovative impact investment instrument to tackle the pandemic, although they have remained heavily underutilized. Furthermore, debt instruments tend to dominate in pandemic-focused impact investments.

One of the unique characteristics of crowdfunding is that funding flows from the online community of individuals and organizations who identify with the campaign and are most interested in its viability and success. Most of these online funding communities (OFCs) are built around common shared goals, ideologies, enthusiasm for, or interests in specific funding activities. Despite this uniqueness, we understand little about the role that these communities play in crowdfunding success. Utilizing a rich dataset integrated from one of the most popular crowdfunding platforms in the UK, we explain how targeting an OFC positively influences crowdfunding success. Following a text similarity approach, we also provide evidence that the congruence between the crowdfunding campaign and targeted OFC is associated with higher success rate.

However, the non-financial value for NVFs is mainly created through a corporate business unit within the CVC's corporate parent company.

The past decade witnessed a surge in the availability of low-code tools, where software-based solutions can be developed with limited or no need for writing code. One of the most salient examples is Shopify, which enables a layperson to become a fully-functioning online retailer without ever resorting to writing code. We ask: how do low-code tools affect growth trajectory and entrepreneurial success? How do they change the resources required to scale-up and grow? We explore these questions in the context of the e-commerce sector during the 2010s. Several databases were integrated to construct a sample covering about 400 VC-backed startups; including a detailed profile of their financial, human and software tools. The analyses indicate that Shopify-based startups start life with fewer financial and human resources compared to their e-commerce peers.

 considerable obstacles in accruing funding and other resources when starting a new venture; problems that are likely compounded when starting a new venture after experiencing failure. In particular, it is unclear how early-stage investors react to entrepreneurs with prior failure experiences in terms of how they perceive the entrepreneur's capabilities and how they evaluate the new venture.

The study examines the impact of participation in formal vocational training on the earnings of rural self-employed individuals in

. The results show that even though formal vocational training helps self-employed individuals earn a higher income and that a great initiative has been taken by the government to promote skill development in recent times, a meagre proportion of rural self-employed has received formal vocational training. Therefore, there is a need for an appropriate policy attention towards enhancing the participation of rural self-employed individuals in the formal vocational training programmes on a grander scale. Moreover, a substantial heterogeneity is observed in terms of the duration of training programmes. A longer duration (12 months or more) training helps enhance the mean earnings significantly as compared to a relatively shorter duration training.

Research suggests that public subsidies for newly founded firms have a positive effect on follow-on financing, in particular on Venture Capital (VC), through providing certification and early-stage liquidity. This study shows that the various sources of VC value public start-up subsidies differently.

We show for a large sample of knowledge-intensive start-ups that there is indeed a correlation between subsidies and all sources of VC (Government VC, Independent VC, Corporate VC, and Business Angels). However, when accounting for firm characteristics that drive both selection into public subsidies as well as into

For many digital ventures, acquiring financial resources in multiple rounds beyond seed funding to grow has become an important part of their entrepreneurial journey. The success rate of raising equity capital beyond their seed investments is, however, very low. Existing entrepreneurship studies on financial resource acquisition have explored separately how entrepreneurs organize their networks, establish venture legitimacy, and decide on funding sources. However, despite being identified as an important subprocess in new venture creation, little is known about why, when, and how entrepreneurs engage potential investors to increase the likelihood of post-seed investments. Hence, this paper synthesizes the literature on financial resource acquisition, theoretical concepts in entrepreneurial financing, and practice knowledge to frame a set of design principles to create a prescriptive process model to increase the likelihood of success in post-seed financial resource acquisition.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,6,"The paper addresses the challenges faced by digital ventures in acquiring post-seed funding, providing a theoretical framework and design principles that could be useful for early-stage startups seeking additional financial resources."

Crowdfunding has become a serious means of financing new ventures. Funders come across numerous, often similar, projects seeking funds, making it difficult for them to decide which project to support. Founders can invest in signals (e.g., filing a patent) to highlight their projects, as signals are a typical communication channel on crowdfunding platforms. We examine how the cost of signaling affects funders' contributions. We modeled a crowdfunding situation using a modified dictator game in the laboratory. Our results illustrate that the higher the founders’ cost of signaling, the more the funders contribute, though not without restrictions; the characteristics of funders matter as reciprocity moderates this effect.

We replicate the Wiklund et al. (2003) study examining the attitudes towards growth of small business managers.

(2003) Swedish study finds, in contrast, that non-economic consequences are the strongest predictor of attitudes towards growth.

Contrary to common hopes and expectations, recent studies dispute the positive relationship between 
entrepreneurship education

entrepreneurship education
 has a ‘sorting effect’, whereby students become more convinced about whether entrepreneurship is appropriate for them or not. Building on goal-setting theory, this study aims to shed more light on the underlying cognitive mechanism of the sorting effect by investigating whether individuals, who exhibit high ‘motivational self-knowledge’ – MSK (i.e. awareness of personal life goals and motives), make more pronounced decisions for or against entrepreneurship. At the same time, we evaluate whether entrepreneurship courses help build professional identity in the sense that motivational self-knowledge increases during the course. Our results show a positive relationship between MSK and the variance in entrepreneurial intentions; particularly when using a higher threshold for ‘high’ MSK. This finding supports the idea that goal hierarchy can be a valuable addition to dominant intention-models in studies on the formation of entrepreneurial intentions. Unfortunately, there is no significant increase in MSK for entrepreneurship students. Considering the benefits of MSK regardless of career choice, this is disappointing.

As physical distancing is a core measure of containing the spread of COVID-19, this pandemic is a crisis that has uprooted social interaction. While current research mainly focuses on crises as a challenge for entrepreneurial ventures and potential regulatory response mechanisms, we complement this research by addressing the question of how crises in general—and COVID-19’s physical distancing measures in particular—shape entrepreneurial opportunities for social innovation. Based on two rounds of data collection—desktop research mapping out 95 
entrepreneurial activities
 in Germany and four focus groups—we find first that entrepreneurs are proactive agents in alleviating the negative consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. They do so by creating two types of digital social innovation: digital brokering and digitized services. Second, we note that negative societal consequences of crises can be buffered by shifts in entrepreneurs’ strategic orientation through improvised venturing, rapid pivoting and pro-social product extension. Third, we note variance in the persistence of changes with consequences for entrepreneurial opportunities and social innovation: Whereas some social innovation are rather ephemeral, others might endure and promise long-term impacts.

In a sample of 2980 firm-year observations collected from three 
industries
 over the five-year period during the Russian economic crisis of 2013–2017, we demonstrate the relative effectiveness of conservative and aggressive strategies for technological leadership in affecting firm performance. Both the conservative strategy aimed at minimizing firm inputs per the set volume of outputs and the aggressive strategy aimed at maximizing the outputs per the set volume of inputs affect performance positively. Of the two alternatives, the aggressive strategy clearly outperforms the conservative one during times of crisis. Additionally, without a clear commitment to either of the strategies, firms stand to lose.

Women entrepreneurs consistently raise far less investor funding than men. In this study, we consider how women’s use of gender-similar language may influence investor decisions on venture pitches. Contrary to theories of communicative style and gender, we find women do

 apply linguistic styles traditionally attributed to women in crafting their pitches. Instead, women entrepreneurs use language similar to their male counterparts when pitching to investors. Consistent with gender role congruity theory, we found that a masculine linguistic style is generally more effective in pitching situations, with limitations.

Although the perceived flexibility of being one’s own boss may draw those with significant family responsibilities to entrepreneurship over traditional employment, existing research on the interface between work and family suggests that conflicts between these two domains arise. In other words, while entrepreneurship may seem like an approach for juggling work and home life commitments, theory on work-life conflict indicates that entrepreneurs 
face
 many of the same struggles of the organizationally employed with family responsibilities. In this paper, we examine the impact of family life responsibilities on the ability of nascent entrepreneurs to accomplish important founding milestones over time. The results indicate that family responsibilities may not have the degree of negative impact on venture-level outcomes that existing theory suggests.

Entrepreneurship today is truly global: international sources of supplies, services, and customers are available to anyone online, and large-scale operations are no longer required to take advantage of global talent, supply, and distribution networks. Yet we do not have a comprehensive understanding of how international firms emerge. Building on previous research at the intersection of entrepreneurship and international business, we propose a theoretical framework for identifying and examining entrepreneurial emergence that is international from the start. This framework builds on the four well-known qualities of emerging organizations (boundaries, resources, intention, and exchange), and three key aspects of international business operations (speed, scope and intensity of internationalization). The resulting model has the potential to help researchers refocus their attention on everyday forms of emerging international firms that are ubiquitous, yet seldom explored.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,7,"The theoretical framework proposed has the potential to help researchers focus on everyday forms of emerging international firms, which can have a practical impact on startups seeking to expand globally."

Project funding performance which determines the rise and fall of the

, is largely governed by the subjective behavior of investors. Leveraging the perspective of attribute substitution theory, we focus on two factors that affect the subjective funding behaviors of investors: emotional language in the 
project description
 and risky funding choices of prior investors. According to the same theory, we classify the projects as either hedonic or utilitarian, identifying whether the association between the factors and funding success of projects vary for hedonic vs. utilitarian projects. Using Kickstarter data, our analysis shows a positive association between the risk-seeking investor ratio and project success for hedonic projects. In addition, it identifies a positive association between the extent to which arousal words are used in project descriptions and project success for all projects. Thus, both positive associations are stronger for hedonic projects than for utilitarian projects. Our findings suggest that investors in crowdfunding contexts do not always make rational decisions in funding projects. This has implications for how a project is positioned within the crowdfunding solicitation marketplace.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,9,"Understanding the subjective funding behaviors of investors in crowdfunding platforms can provide valuable insights for early-stage ventures looking to secure funding, making it highly relevant and impactful."

This study explores the affective turmoil experienced by nascent entrepreneurs during opportunity recognition and exploitation. Based on the affect circumplex model, we employed nonlinear methods to identify configurations of affect that emerge during these early stages of the entrepreneurial journey. We analyzed data from 50 nascent entrepreneurs using Artificial 
Neural Networks
 (ANNs) trained with twenty affect dimensions as input variables and opportunity recognition and opportunity exploitation as outcomes. Results show that nascent entrepreneurs experience different affect configurations during opportunity recognition and exploitation. While four configurations of affect emerged associated with opportunity recognition and exploitation, their nature and importance to the experienced event are significantly different. Specifically, “active screening” is the most important configuration of affect during opportunity recognition, while “vigilant” is the most important during opportunity exploitation. We posit that nonlinear methods can help to uncover the affective turmoil experienced by entrepreneurs during a particular event. These findings provide new insights on how affect associates differently with cognition during the early stages of entrepreneurship.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,6,"The study on affective turmoil in nascent entrepreneurs provides some insights, but may have limited immediate applicability for startups."

The emergence of 
impact investing
 over the past decade has been accompanied by increased interest in impact measurement to understand both social and financial returns. One of the constantly re-occurring themes in the research on impact measurement is the tension between financial return and social/environmental mission. However, we challenge this binary view by addressing the following questions: is the profit/purpose trade-off dilemma an immutable feature of 
impact investing
? And, if so, how are investor-investee relationships negotiated through those tensions to keep the impact measurement process flowing productively? Using an exploratory multi-round 
Delphi Method
 study (15 panellists) and 22 semi-structured interviews, we discover a new set of impact measurement practices, which are relational and non-transactional in nature. These two levels of engagement, the transactional and the relational, occur in sequence and reinforce each other, ultimately creating both instrumental and intrinsic value. In the end, we propose the Transactional-Relational Spiral model and encourage further research and validation.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,9,The exploration of impact investing and the proposal of a new Transactional-Relational Spiral model offer valuable insights for early-stage ventures seeking funding and impact measurement strategies.

Access to credit is crucial for SMEs’ survival. However, due to the opaqueness of publicly available information on SMEs, banks face 
information asymmetry

We contribute to the literature on trust-based banking by using new data to add robustness to extant results, and by discussing two important and still overlooked venues requiring further research. Using two waves of original survey data on 160 Finnish SMEs, our results support findings from prior studies by showing a robust positive relationship between trust and credit access (measured one year apart). We also find support for the hitherto assumed but not explicitly tested substitutability of trust and formal information: trust matters but only when formal information for assessing the SME’s creditworthiness is insufficient. We then identify a future research agenda by highlighting that we do not yet know how banks use qualitative factors such as trust to make lending decisions, nor whether the common implicit assumption of symmetric trust between borrower and lender is realistic.

Research summary
Times of crisis require entrepreneurial responses to mitigate adverse effects and address new opportunities. This study focuses on how packaged food and drink entrepreneurs in Finland took action to create and capture new value during the Covid-19 crisis. Examining 844 social media posts of 66 ventures between March and May 2020 and interviewing 17 of these ventures, we found ventures to experiment with new business model variations, which not only expanded their set of solutions directly, but resulted in action-based learning leading to longer-term changes and increased capabilities for subsequent value creation. Furthermore, collaborative experiments and prosocial support increased the solution space through developing the capabilities of the ecosystem.

The entrepreneurs’ sequences of cognitive activities and cognitive effort are distinctively influenced by the nature of the failing venture as they reach the decision to persist or exit, regardless of the entrepreneurs’ baseline motivations.

Nascent entrepreneurs are frequently advised to “get out of the building” and consult with customers before any serious efforts to develop new products or services are undertaken so they can understand what their potential customers really want/need. Despite the intuitive nature of this advice, it lacks theoretical and empirical bases. As such, the worldwide popularity of the movements this approach has spawned, such as Customer Development and Lean Startup, seems to rest on the unfounded assumption that the benefits of involving customers outweighs any costs. Thus, we theorize about the pros and cons of involving customers early on in the startup process and empirically test our model using data from the PSED II.

Entrepreneurs are expected to seek forgiveness from stakeholders for a transgression. While research has shown that apologies issued by entrepreneurs can be an effective tool for obtaining forgiveness, there is no assurance that an apology leading to stakeholder forgiveness will also necessarily restore future cooperation.

Owing to the lack of a track record, new ventures, by definition, tend to lack a strong reputation and often resort to reputation borrowing by affiliating with high-reputation actors. We study how entrepreneurial reputation-borrowing works in a context where reputation sources are scarce. We undertook an in-depth field study of a new venture in an emerging economy setting – specifically in Bangalore, India, at a time when a nascent entrepreneurial ecosystem was emerging. We examine the process and consequences of reputation-borrowing for this venture, which forged a relationship with a large Western multinational after entering a prestigious academic incubator. In terms of the process, we highlight the importance of high-status institutional intermediaries such as incubators in reputation-deficient contexts. In relation to the consequences, our study surfaces a tension: since successfully borrowing reputation is relatively rare in emerging economy settings, it may lead to hubris and (subsequent) lapses in judgment vis-à-vis the venture’s own altercentric uncertainty. Given this prospect of a “liability of a good reputation”, entrepreneurial reputation-borrowing in an emerging economy may need to be “handled with care” – in terms of reducing a new venture’s own uncertainty reduction during the process and not letting down its guard after reputation has been borrowed.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,5,"The abstract delves into reputation-borrowing by new ventures in emerging economies, highlighting the potential risks and consequences.

Scaling social impact is regarded as the main currency in social 
enterprise
 and social entrepreneurship. Many social enterprises scale their social impact through ecosystem growth strategy, under which they indirectly address targeted social problems by growing and/or sustaining a supportive social 
enterprise
 ecosystem through activities such as organising advocacy campaigns and supporting other social enterprises to grow. However, the existing literature is largely biased towards the success stories of ecosystem growth strategy. Countering this “success bias”, this article presents a framework describing how, under certain conditions, scaling social impact through ecosystem growth strategy can create unintended consequences. In doing so, this paper also challenges the prevailing reductionist view of ecosystem growth as a social impact scaling strategy and provides a more reliable and comprehensive account of this scaling strategy. This article hopes to stimulate future research on greater understanding and management of unintended consequences of ecosystem growth strategy in social enterprise, as well as delineating the boundary conditions of this strategy with regard to scaling social impact.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,3,"The abstract discusses the unintended consequences of scaling social impact through ecosystem growth strategy in social enterprises.

Our replication also extends prior findings in two critical ways. First, it shows that independence is essential in developing a comprehensive understanding of the decision-making process for participating in a corporate venture. Second, it demonstrates that entrepreneurial self-efficacy influences the effects of employment risk and expected success on the relationship between profit sharing and employees’ willingness to participate in a corporate venture.

Research on societal grand challenges has become a major theme in management research. Societal grand challenges require joint efforts by private, public, and social sector organizations and are described in the framework of the United Nations’ 
Sustainable Development Goals
 (SDGs). One major contributor to this framework are social entrepreneurial ventures. Aligning their interventions and indicators with the SDGs can provide them with great benefits such as facilitating

Individual Entrepreneurial Orientation (IEO) is a three-dimensional conceptualization of 
personality traits
 that influence entrepreneurial outcomes, and it includes risk-taking, innovativeness, and 
proactiveness
. Much is still unknown about IEO, in part due to the relative recency of its conceptualization and subsequent operationalization. Advancing our understanding of IEO could be greatly hastened if an existing, widespread measure was shown to approximate a supported measure of IEO. Existing datasets using this widespread measure could be reanalyzed to derive new inferences regarding IEO, and future authors administering this widespread measure for other purposes could simultaneously study IEO. One such nonproprietary measure that may gauge IEO is the HEXACO-100 (also labeled the HEXACO-PI-R). In the current article, we identify a collection of items from the HEXACO-100 that closely approximate a supported measure of IEO and its three dimensions, as evidenced by the measure’s 
psychometric
 properties as well as convergent and criterion validity. We label this collection of items the HEXACO-IEO. The identification of this measure opens many avenues for future research. The HEXACO-100 has been studied alongside a wide array of constructs – constructs that can now be studied alongside IEO. Also, the current study connects IEO with specific dimensions of the HEXACO. As this framework has been linked with many 
personality theories
, IEO can too be linked with these theories. We specifically suggest that the Situation, Trait, and Outcome Activation (STOA) model may offer notable insights into IEO. Thus, the current article provides many implications for research on entrepreneurship, personality, and their intersection.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,8,Advancing the understanding of Individual Entrepreneurial Orientation (IEO) and providing a measure like HEXACO-IEO can be beneficial for startups in assessing their entrepreneurial traits and making informed decisions.

The idea that there exist undiscovered entrepreneurial endowments fell into disfavor after Gartner's (1988) “‘Who is an entrepreneur?’ is the wrong question”. However, a resurgence of the “question of the entrepreneur” suggests that advances in genetics research may be the key to discovering what makes entrepreneurs distinctive. This paper draws from Wittgensteinian philosophy to offer a novel critique regarding the search for differences between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. We explain that the idea that entrepreneurs are different gains credence through misleading forms of language that 1) encourage the illusion of some causal interplay between opportunities and potential entrepreneurs, and 2) overshadow the contingent nature of 
entrepreneurial action
. We sidestep misleading forms of thought to suggest that ontological reflection on the nature of entrepreneurial agency shows why we will never discover some “entrepreneurial gene”. Equally important, this Wittgensteinian critique demonstrates the limits of empirical research for problems that fundamentally require conceptual attention – not more determined effort or advanced research methods.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,2,The abstract focuses on philosophical critique and ontological reflection rather than practical implications for startups.

Research summary
The discovery of the 
coronavirus
 (SARS-CoV-2) and the spread of COVID-19 have led many governments to take drastic measures. The

 of large parts of society and economic life has come as an exogenous shock to many economic actors, not least innovative startups. This rapid response research combines a qualitative research design informed by 
entrepreneurial ecosystem
 actors with an analysis of policy measures called for, announced, and reportedly implemented in the international press. Interviews from an entrepreneurial ecosystem offer a first-hand account of the adversity startups 
face
 during a crisis and how by utilizing

 responses they cope, and the analysis of policy measures can serve as an inspiration to design support initiatives to protect startups from the consequences of the current lockdown and to alleviate the effects of future crises.
Managerial summary
The lockdown measures as a response to the spread of the new coronavirus threaten the existence of many innovative startups. Our rapid response research first illustrates the challenges entrepreneurs face as a consequence of the crisis. Second, we illustrate how entrepreneurs are dealing with the effects of the crisis and what they are doing to protect their ventures. Finally, we present measures that could be utilized by policymakers to assist entrepreneurs facing challenges. The research conducted suggests that while startups are successfully leveraging their available resources as a first response to the crisis, their growth and innovation potential are at risk. Therefore, policy measures should not only provide first aid to startups by alleviating the pressure caused by constrained cashflow, but also involve long-term measures embedded in and supported by the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem to ensure rapid recovery and growth.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,8,"The abstract addresses the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on startups and provides insights into coping strategies and policy measures, which are highly relevant for early-stage ventures."

Research on entrepreneurial 
personality traits

Much research has been conducted studying entry into self-employment and the corresponding rewards and consequences of self-employment on earnings. The literature finds mixed results regarding whether workers enter self-employment to maximize their pecuniary or their non-pecuniary benefits. This paper suggests that whether workers are able to increase their pecuniary or non-pecuniary benefits in self-employment depends on their motivations for entering self-employment in the first place. This study uses longitudinal NSF SESTAT data on over 28,000 scientists and engineers to track 
employment changes
 and changes in work outcomes over time for the same individuals. The research examines changes in pecuniary and non-pecuniary work outcomes when wage workers transition to self-employment, compared to those who do not change employers, as well as to those who change employers but do not transition to self-employment. This allows a deeper look at the implications of different types of mobility on work outcomes. The findings show that in general those who transition to self-employment experience improvements in their non-pecuniary outcomes but not in their pecuniary outcomes, however the results do differ depending on the motivation for moving. Using job satisfaction as a proxy measure for non-pecuniary benefits, this paper finds that while those who enter self-employment from wage work do generally improve their job satisfaction, job satisfaction rises for all movers, not just for those who enter self-employment.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,5,"While the study provides insights into self-employment outcomes, the focus on scientists and engineers limits the generalizability to early-stage ventures."

Based on 1,692 state-quarter observations from 2005 to 2013, higher state minimum wage is negatively associated with a count of applications for EIN and count of applicants transitioning into employer business and slows the transition of applicants into employer businesses. The findings are robust to a placebo test and an alternate specification controlling for common correlation between state and year. Additional analyses on new business activity show that state minimum wage has no association with the portion of the state population starting new businesses or the share of opportunity-based (vs. necessity-based) new businesses in a state.

Several biases are known to influence funding decisions in crowdfunding. Among these biases is herding behavior; that is, the tendency to imitate the funding decisions of others. Herding is a very robust phenomenon in crowdfunding and uniformly characterized as a positive reinforcement effect. We challenge this characterization and ask whether the funding decisions of others may in fact have a negative effect and lead to a reduction of follow-up funding decisions if they are very small – a phenomenon to which we refer as 
reverse herding
. We conducted a field experiment at a reward-based crowdfunding platform by randomly contributing small funding amounts to some campaigns while keeping track of a non-manipulated control group. Our findings support the notion of reverse herding. The number and amount of contributions by the crowd following our small funding amounts were fewer and smaller than in the control group. We discuss reverse herding in relation to established crowdfunding concepts and formulate a dilemma of small contributions: Although small contributions are a fundamental part of crowdfunding, they can also cause the detrimental effect of reverse herding. Practical and theoretical implications of reverse herding are discussed and several opportunities for future research are outlined.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,7,"The concept of reverse herding in crowdfunding is novel and challenges established ideas, providing insights for early-stage ventures."

Hybrid entrepreneurship—where an individual simultaneously engages in startup activities as well as wage-based employment—is an increasingly common career transition path. Yet, relatively little research has explored entrepreneurial characteristics during these unique career transitions. We provide exploratory insight into the longitudinal relationship between self-efficacy and persistence for hybrid entrepreneurs’ (
N

As such, we propose that entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) and entrepreneurial persistence are malleable concepts that change over time. Using our longitudinal sample, we find evidence that ESE predicts entrepreneurial persistence change over time. Perhaps more importantly, we model how changes in ESE over time affect changes in entrepreneurial persistence for hybrid entrepreneurs. In sum, our work provides a foundation from which future research can examine the longitudinal transition of nascent entrepreneurs moving from an occupational setting as an employee to launching their own venture.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,6,Exploring the characteristics of hybrid entrepreneurship can offer valuable insights for startups with individuals engaged in multiple career paths.

A quintessential bane in the modern workforce is finding meaningful work, or work that is perceived to meaningfully contribute to society.

Entrepreneurship is a generative and transformative process of altering convention where personal/social history, assets, technologies, and trading activity are gathered in organizational form. How entrepreneurs frame this process, and are, in turn, organised by this process, constitutes the entrepreneurial experience. Typically this framing has been researched using narrative methods: how entrepreneurs tell their stories. In this paper we develop an emerging branch of inquiry challenging a sole focus on linguistic narrative in favour of accessing the experience of entrepreneurs by asking them to draw an image of their venture using pencils and paper. Drawing has long been recognised in other social science disciplines as an empirical method for eliciting in-depth and latent information about complex or difficult experiences. In this paper we show some indicative drawings created by entrepreneurs, accompanied by their verbal explanations of what these drawings represent for them, and we highlight how the process was a generative exercise for the entrepreneurs. We focus on two aspects of drawing, which we refer to as “beginnings”, and “traces”, that we feel are particularly relevant to why this medium is valuable for exploring the experience of entrepreneurs.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,7,"The use of drawing as a method to explore the experiences of entrepreneurs presents a unique and potentially valuable approach to understanding their ventures, which could offer insights for startups in Europe."

Challenge-based entrepreneurship is a nascent research area that has sought to tackle a longstanding issue of how entrepreneurs may overcome extreme challenges. We seek fresh insights into this issue by researching entrepreneurs who face one of the most extreme physical challenges, namely of acute sight loss (“blindness”). While this condition carries social perceptions of extreme physical incapacity and performance limitations, there continue to be notable examples of entrepreneurs with permanent blindness. How do blind entrepreneurs overcome barriers resulting from their impairment? By observing and conversing with two blind serial entrepreneurs, we offer preliminary answers to this question by generating insights into processes of opportunity formation in which ideas are conceived and developed out of the entrepreneurs' challenges. Our chief finding is that our blind entrepreneurs instrumentalized their impairments for commercial or social purposes by creating ventures that leveraged public perceptions of blindness and disability. Accordingly, in their ventures, our entrepreneurs drew on distinctive attributes of their physical and social challenges as a means of exploiting narrow conceptions of disabled people's capabilities. These entrepreneurs therefore overcame their challenges by capitalizing on public conceptions of their limited capabilities. The subsequent 
Discussion
 offers research opportunities in and beyond challenge-based entrepreneurship by considering a number of theoretical and practical implications of the adaptive skills and attributes of our entrepreneurs that have enabled them to engage with popular “ableist” and medical, or “tragic”, perceptions of disability in original and positive ways.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,9,"The exploration of how blind entrepreneurs overcome challenges and leverage public perceptions presents novel and impactful insights that could inspire and inform startups in Europe, making it highly valuable."

Rewards based crowdfunding (where individuals provide funding for a campaign in exchange for a pre-specified reward) represents one of the largest forms of crowdfunding to date. While an emerging stream of research examines how the rhetoric used in crowdfunding campaigns impacts funding success, a number of studies examining language used in crowdfunding have only been explored in the context of social crowdfunding campaigns that rely on very different audiences, funding amounts, and project goals. To build knowledge surrounding the relationship between the rhetoric used in rewards-based crowdfunding and potential campaign success we replicate a number of rhetoric approaches previously examined in social contexts. Specifically, we examine the efficacy of charismatic rhetoric, political rhetoric, entrepreneurial orientation rhetoric, and virtue rhetoric in a sample of 1000 campaigns drawn from Kickstarter.

This paper investigates how potential backers' perception of user entrepreneur characteristics influences the success of a crowdfunding campaign. We hypothesize that the accentuation of user entrepreneur characteristics is associated with higher crowdfunding success, i.e. with the chance to reach a campaign goal successfully. Data from 963 Kickstarter campaigns provides an ambiguous picture: while trend leadership shows the hypothesized effect, a high benefit expected accentuated in a product campaign is actually detrimental for its performance. Extending the reasoning of affection based models to predict crowdfunding success, we draw on capitalization theory for an explanation. While a high benefit expected may prompt personal positive emotional responses, it may fail to trigger consumer's word of mouth reactions, the sharing of positive events with significant others. Our data reveals that the perception of user entrepreneurship characteristics leads to significantly lower rates of sharing a campaign on Facebook and to fewer user comments on Kickstarter. By highlighting the differential effects that user entrepreneur characteristics exhibit on crowdfunding campaign success, our results have important implications for crowdfunding theory and practice.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,7,The study on how user entrepreneur characteristics influence crowdfunding success provides valuable insights for startups engaging in crowdfunding campaigns.

Whereas social entrepreneurship has been extensively studied, its antipode—antisocial entrepreneurship—is all but neglected in the literature. This article identifies and elucidates this glaring conceptual and research gap; it provides a conceptual foundation for making sense of antisocial entrepreneurship, demonstrating how it is distinct from related constructs such as illegal and destructive entrepreneurship; and it suggests an agenda for future research on antisocial entrepreneurship. Through studying antisocial entrepreneurship, a broader spectrum of entrepreneurial intentions, actions and outcomes becomes visible, potentially furthering our understanding, not only of antisocial entrepreneurship, but also of other, more commonly studied, facets of entrepreneurship.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,3,The concept of antisocial entrepreneurship is interesting but may have limited practical value for early-stage ventures.

Knowledge production in Pure Digital Entrepreneurship (PDE) needs to reflect the non-linear nature of a journey defined by digital artifact and platform creation. Accordingly, this paper proposes and offers practical guidance on the use of 
Multimethod Insider 
Action Research
 (MIAR) as a suitable research design for studying the entrepreneurial journey in this context. It argues for integrating first-person 
Reflective Practice
, second-person 
Collaborative Inquiry
 and 
Design Research
 for third-person knowledge production that balances rigour and relevance. While calls for such forms of longitudinal process inquiry have largely gone unanswered due to identified challenges, this paper uses a case 
narrative
 to illustrate the feasibility of conducting them in a PDE context.",Business Venturing Insights,08 Mar 2025,7,The practical guidance on using MIAR for studying Pure Digital Entrepreneurship has high potential impact for early-stage ventures in Europe.
