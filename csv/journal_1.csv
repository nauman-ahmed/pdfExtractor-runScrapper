Whether individuals grew up as first-born or later-born siblings in their families can influence their behavior well into adulthood. This study examines the impact of birth order on networking behavior and entrepreneurial action, integrating birth order theory with psychological threat response theories. It suggests that first-born and later-born entrepreneurs inherently differ in their social responses to the uncertainties and threats of entrepreneurship, which affects how intensively they engage in networking behavior and entrepreneurial action. Three empirical studies involving over 900 entrepreneurs were conducted using between-family analysis. The results indicate that later-borns, overall, exhibit more adaptive behavior than first-borns when navigating the challenges of entrepreneurship: Especially when facing severe threatening obstacles, later-born entrepreneurs tend to intensify their efforts to build, seek, and use external networks, which enables them to engage in more entrepreneurial action. This study offers new insights into the relationship between birth order and entrepreneurship, enhancing our understanding of why some individuals may respond more adaptively to threats, network more intensively, and exploit opportunities more actively than others.", March 2025,"Birth order, Entrepreneurial action, Networking, Obstacles, Family",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

This article extends existing scholarship that views hype primarily as an individual entrepreneurial storytelling strategy for generating excitement about a venture's future. We argue that hype also functions as a cultural marker, distinguishing entrepreneurial modes of communication and behavior from those of traditional corporate culture. By tracing the conceptual history of hype, we demonstrate that the term and its associated practices (a.) originated in early-twentieth-century criminal subcultures to distinguish them from respectable culture, (b.) was subsequently adopted by mid-twentieth-century countercultures to distinguish themselves from mainstream culture, and (c.) ultimately became a marker used by late twentieth-century startup culture to distinguish itself from corporate culture. Understanding these historical roots, we contend, illuminates key characteristics of contemporary Western startup culture: the valorization of revolutionary futures, the celebration of rule-breaking, and the embrace of social deviance as a hallmark of entrepreneurial authenticity. By historicizing hype in this manner, we can better appreciate both its “destructive” and “productive” dimensions and explore alternative modes of communication that are prevalent in other entrepreneurial contexts.", March 2025,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Entrepreneurs seeking legitimacy for their stigmatized products with mainstream audiences must deploy strategies to redefine their products' cultural significance. This paper investigates how the body, often a focal point of stigma, serves as the foundation for these strategies.

Research on social media influencers and entrepreneurship tends to adopt an influencer-as-entrepreneur perspective by examining how influencers leverage social media as entrepreneurial opportunities. However, it remains unclear how entrepreneurs in the audience interpret and leverage influencer content in their entrepreneurial endeavors. Using a two-study approach, Study 1 inductively uncovers that entrepreneurs interpret entrepreneurship influencers' content as para-social mentoring—a one-to-many, mostly unreciprocated mentor-protégé relationship in which media users envision themselves as protégés and perceive media figures as providing individualized career-related and psychosocial support despite knowing that the media figures do not know intimate details about themselves or their circumstances. Our model posits that para-social mentoring between entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship influencers relates to critical entrepreneurship-related outcomes. Using data from 613 entrepreneurs, Study 2 deductively finds general support for the model derived from Study 1.

While we understand the importance of entrepreneurs listening to stakeholders, we lack a sufficient theory-driven understanding of why some entrepreneurs and their ventures can listen to their stakeholders more effectively than others. We offer a listening model of venture growth based on listening theories and the literatures on new ventures and capability development. Listening is initially facilitated by entrepreneurs' cognitive and behavioral processes, but continued venture growth creates a paradox for entrepreneurs. Listening to stakeholders may also deplete entrepreneurs' personal resources, diminishing their listening capacity. This paradox can be overcome by generating their ventures' listening capability—behavioral routines and attention structures for listening—enabling them to acquire and interpret quality information from stakeholders more effectively to build or adapt the capabilities necessary for venture growth. The ventures' listening capability acts as a dynamic capability, which itself can be dynamic. This listening model of venture growth contributes to the entrepreneurship literature on stakeholders, entrepreneurs' abilities, and ventures' capabilities and dynamic capabilities.
Executive summary
Entrepreneurs need to acquire resources from stakeholders to create and grow their ventures. Therefore, stakeholder enrollment is a critical task for entrepreneurs. The predominant research on stakeholder enrollment has been on entrepreneurs' overt behaviors to secure the support of stakeholders—a unidirectional communication pattern in which entrepreneurs communicate to audiences and stakeholders listen to and decide whether to commit their resources to ventures. However, entrepreneurs need to communicate and listen to their stakeholders. Although scholars recognize the importance of entrepreneurs listening to stakeholders, we lack sufficient understanding of why some entrepreneurs and their ventures can listen to their stakeholders more effectively than others and thus acquire and use stakeholder support critical for venture growth. Therefore, we ask, Why are some entrepreneurial actors more effective at listening to stakeholders than others?
To address this question, we integrate theories of listening and the literatures on new ventures and the creation of organizational capabilities to develop a listening model of venture growth. This model explains the importance and the limitations of entrepreneurs' listening ability in acquiring and interpreting stakeholder information for venture growth. Venture members can learn from and formalize entrepreneurs' listening ability to build ventures' listening capability, which overcomes the entrepreneurs' listening limitations. Ventures' listening capability includes acquiring and interpreting stakeholder information to inform and/or change additional capabilities critical for venture growth.
Specifically, the model begins with communication from stakeholders to an entrepreneur and their venture. The entrepreneur engages cognitively in listening to the stakeholders' communication and acquiring and interpreting this stakeholder information. The entrepreneur also listens behaviorally, providing back-channeling that encourages the stakeholders to share more high-quality information. The entrepreneur's listening ability can enhance and change the venture's capabilities. However, the entrepreneur's ability to notice and interpret stakeholder information is limited. Other venture members can learn the entrepreneur's cognitive and behavioral listening to represent an organizational-level listening capability. This listening capability is reflected in the venture's routines and attention structures.
The venture's listening capability can build and adapt the venture's nonlistening capabilities. The venture's capabilities drive venture growth. Because the listening capability generates and enables the interpretation of more high-quality stakeholder information, the venture can use this information to change its capabilities to obtain or maintain a tight fit with a changing environment. In doing so, the venture's listening capability represents a dynamic capability—listening can change the venture's capabilities.
As the venture grows, the strain on the entrepreneur's listening ability further constrains the entrepreneur as a source of information for building and adapting the venture's capabilities. Venture growth also stretches the venture's listening capability, leading to changes in this listening capability and thus building and adapting the venture's nonlistening capabilities for subsequent venture growth. Venture growth can also lead to an increase in stakeholders and, thus, more stakeholder information to be noticed and interpreted by the venture's listening capability and to adapt the venture's nonlistening capabilities if necessary.
With this work, we make three primary contributions to the entrepreneurship literature: We provide theoretical insights into (1) the workings of entrepreneurs' listening ability for promoting venture growth; (2) entrepreneurs' learning from their listening ability and formalizing this ability into organizational capabilities, which is critical for information to enact nonlistening capabilities for venture growth; and (3) a venture's listening capability as a dynamic capability.", January 2025,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

This study explores how corporate venture capital (CVC) units can be configured to effectively achieve innovation performance and succeed amidst the tensions they face at the intersection of the corporate and venture domain. Using a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of 30 dedicated CVC investment arms, we analyze how successful units configure their internal arrangements in response to these tensions and generate various innovation outcomes for their parent organizations. We identify four different solutions for effective CVC unit configurations, highlighting that explorative and exploitative innovation success require different setups. Moreover, we find that more mature and explorative CVC units distance themselves via buffering from their corporate sponsor, while at the same time increasing their efforts to maintain deliberate connections via bridging to representatives of the very same corporate environment they stem from. For ambidextrous CVC units, a more dynamic setup that allows corporate leadership to selectively initiate collaboration with the corporate core when beneficial while facilitating distancing at other times proved successful. Our study contributes new evidence and theory on how CVC units can navigate tensions and balance competing demands at the interface of the corporate and venturing domains.", January 2025,"M13, L21, L22, O32",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

We draw from theories of generations and imprinting to introduce an alternative conceptualization of the effects of age on entrepreneurship—namely, entrepreneurs' generational imprints. We theorize how imprinted characteristics of entrepreneurs from a conservative generation (vs. a progressive generation) are positively (negatively) associated with higher levels of financial returns and negatively (positively) associated with higher engagement in corporate social responsibility. In two studies in the Mexican context, we find that entrepreneurs from a conservative generation create more financial value than social value, while entrepreneurs from a progressive generation create more social value than financial value. We also explore the intervening mechanisms and find that entrepreneurs who are more embedded in the church and their families and have more family obligations are more likely to experience generational imprinting. We further show that women tend to experience generational imprinting differently than men, leading to important heterogeneity in our results. Finally, we find that older entrepreneurs experience generational imprints more acutely than their counterparts. Overall, this study provides new insights into entrepreneurs' generational imprints and demonstrates how and why generational imprinting matters in entrepreneurial research.", January 2025,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Drawing on entrepreneurial financing literature, we investigate how venture capital (VC) firms' investment horizons affect their ventures' product quality problems. We argue that when a VC firm has a short investment horizon, it may guide its portfolio companies to develop new products fast to increase the likelihood of successful exits. However, this deliberate effort may act as a double-edged sword for ventures. That is, VC firms' guidance on product commercialization could inadvertently expose ventures to product quality problems. Building on this notion, we suggest that ventures backed by VC firms with short investment horizons may experience more product quality problems than those backed by VC firms with long investment horizons. We further suggest that the effect of a VC firm's investment horizon on product quality problems is mitigated when the venture is invested by corporate VC investors but amplified when the venture develops complex products. We test our hypotheses using a dataset on product recalls of VC-backed ventures in the U.S. medical device industry.
Executive summary
The success and survival of new ventures largely depend on their ability to develop and commercialize innovative products. Due to their limited resources, these ventures often seek support from venture capital (VC) investors. However, the involvement of VC investors can be a double-edged sword, as their focus on timely (or even accelerated) product introduction may lead to unforeseen problems. This occurs because VC firms may adopt different approaches to supporting ventures in new product development, depending on their investment horizons, which are constrained by their contractual obligations to their limited partners (LPs). Specifically, VC firms with long investment horizons may allow their portfolio companies to have sufficient time to develop new products. In contrast, VC firms with short investment horizons may be under time pressure and guide their portfolio companies to speed up the product development process to increase the chances of ventures' exits within a limited timeline.
Building on this notion, we examine how the investment horizons of VC investors impact ventures' product quality problems. Ventures invested by VC firms with short investment horizons may face pressure to accelerate the new product development process, preventing the ventures from engaging in time-intensive learning processes necessary for cultivating new technological and market knowledge. Therefore, we propose that ventures invested by VC firms with short investment horizons may experience more product quality problems than those invested by VC firms with long investment horizons. We further propose two boundary conditions to validate our theoretical mechanisms. First, we suggest that the negative effect of VC investors' time horizons on product quality problems is mitigated by the presence of corporate VC (CVC) firms in the investment syndicate. As CVC firms have long investment horizons and pursue strategic goals, they can counterbalance the influence of VC firms with short investment horizons on ventures' product development process. Second, we suggest that the complexity of the products developed by ventures amplifies the impact of VC firms' investment horizons on product quality problems. This is because complex products require more time for intensive learning and information processing, making ventures particularly susceptible to product quality problems when under time pressure.
To test these arguments, we use the data on product recalls of VC-backed ventures in the U.S. medical device industry. We also incorporate insights from interviews with venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to validate our arguments. This study enhances our understanding of how partner-specific characteristics (VC firms' investment horizons in our context) affect private ventures' development paths and outcomes. By highlighting the tradeoffs associated with VC funding, we provide a more balanced perspective to the literature on VC investments, which has predominantly emphasized the benefits of VC investment. Our arguments and findings suggest that the time pressure faced by VC investors can be transferred to ventures, potentially resulting in unexpected product quality problems.", January 2025,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Raising money from family and friends is a common form of startup funding. However, we know little about how accepting funds from these individuals influences an entrepreneur's risk-taking preferences. We theorize that as an entrepreneur's relationship with an investor strengthens, the entrepreneur is more likely to anticipate guilt that could emerge from a potential venture failure, which prompts the entrepreneur to make more conservative venture growth decisions. We test our model using a quasi-experimental vignette-based approach. Based on the results, we argue that the tendency for an entrepreneur to become more risk averse in their entrepreneurial decision making due to feelings of anticipated guilt after receiving funding from strong ties demonstrates a

In equity crowdfunding (ECF), early investments serve as signals of venture potential to prospective investors, making them more likely to join an offering. We argue that ECF platform team members can exploit this mechanism and convey false signals to unsophisticated investors. Data from a prominent ECF platform indicate that platform team members “invest” in ventures that exhibit weaker post-campaign outcomes. However, in ventures that successfully fundraise, platform team members typically withdraw their investment (after it incentivized others to join), and these ventures show even weaker post-campaign outcomes. Finally, ventures' post-campaign outcomes are particularly weak when this “invest-and-withdraw” tactic is executed by the platform's upper echelons, whose investments can further be perceived as endorsement signals by the crowd, despite significant goal incongruence between the upper echelons and the crowd. Our study presents novel theoretical and empirical insights into the signaling, financial misconduct, and ECF literature, and holds important policy implications.
Executive summary
Past research has shown that equity crowdfunding (ECF) platforms can reduce agency problems between entrepreneurs and ECF investors, such as adverse selection problems, by providing selection and due diligence activities. In other words, past research has focused on the bright side of ECF platforms. However, this study focuses on a possible dark side of ECF platforms. The paper investigates the practice of ECF platform team members fabricating support (i.e., using an invest-and-withdraw tactic) towards firms with weaker prospects listed on their own platform.
ECF platform team members can use an invest-and-withdraw tactic in firms with weaker prospects. Indeed, through their investments, ECF platform team members influence early investments, which are often used by prospective ECF investors as a quality signal to influence their own investment decisions. However, platform team members then withdraw their investments (after their investment lured follow-on investors to the offering). As such, platform team members convey false signals to unsophisticated ECF investors. The paper highlights an underexplored agency problem between ECF platforms and investors, where platform goals (such as higher platform fundraising success rates and increasing revenue generation, which require platforms where more deals get done) may conflict with investor interests.
Theoretically, these agency problems and the fact that one can withdraw investments at zero cost during a cooling-off period may explain why ECF platform team members engage in false signaling to support firms with weaker prospects. More specifically, we expect that platform team members will invest in firms with weaker post-campaign prospects. Also, their investment withdrawals are expected to be especially correlated with weaker post-campaign venture outcomes. Finally, the investments of the platform’s upper echelons are expected to be particularly correlated with weaker post-campaign outcomes.
Empirically, we use unique data from a leading ECF platform from a country with developed financial markets. The paper provides empirical support for the above expectations and underscores the need for policy attention to mitigate such possible misconduct. The goals of ECF platform team members are unlikely to always align with what ECF investors want. More specifically, ECF platform team members can use private information and exploit rules meant to protect buyers online (i.e., the cooling-off period, which allows for investment withdrawals at no cost) to support the fundraising of firms with weaker prospects on their platform.
Our research adds to the signaling literature by highlighting false signals conveyed by ECF platform team members and especially the upper echelon members. The paper further contributes to the misconduct literature in entrepreneurial finance, which has mostly focused on entrepreneur and/or investor misconduct, while we focused on possible misconduct by platform team members who are generally viewed as benign. It focuses on an underexplored agency problem in entrepreneurial finance between platforms and ECF investors. The paper also adds to the ECF literature by providing novel insights into post-campaign venture outcomes. Finally, the paper further contributes to the discussion about the need for better regulations in ECF markets. More transparent information and limiting the possibility of invest-and-withdraw tactics might help channel funds to the most promising ventures, ultimately providing added value for the economy and ensuring the long-term prospects of the ECF market.", January 2025,"Equity crowdfunding, Misconduct, Information cascades, Platforms, Digital finance, Entrepreneurial finance",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

However, as these investors join syndicates, ventures can raise larger financing amounts without compromising managerial support. Taken together, these factors positively affect the performance of entrepreneurial ventures. To test our hypotheses, we consider the case of Germany, where the federal government has introduced an investment grant for angel investors.

We investigate the impact of friction-reducing labor market reforms on regional high-growth entrepreneurship (HGE) through the effects of reduced legal enforceability of noncompete agreements (NCAs).

We assemble a novel multi-level longitudinal dataset and employ staggered difference-in-differences estimation to assess causal effects. Our findings suggest that while reducing the enforceability of NCAs can foster regional HGE, the effectiveness of such reforms is heavily influenced by concurrent federal and local institutional changes. In sectors facing significant federal regulatory expansion, the benefits brought by the reduction of NCA enforceability are negated. However, local pro-market institutional changes can counteract the disabling effects of federal regulatory expansion. This highlights the need to consider how the evolving institutional environment influences potential enablers of HGE, cautioning against claims that these labor market reforms (or other exogenous environmental changes) universally yield positive entrepreneurship outcomes.", November 2024,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

As consumer behaviors changed during the COVID-19 crisis, smallness and innovativeness became liabilities while scale and familiarity became indispensable, favoring larger breweries over prototypical members. This shift exposed hidden divisions within the category, challenging long-held beliefs in shared fate and entrenching heterogeneity among members.

Hype occurs when expectations exceed reality. For founders promoting innovative technologies, hype often attracts the resources necessary to grow a new venture. Hype is gaining prominence in entrepreneurship literature, and it is understood that many entrepreneurs jumpstart their ventures by promoting optimistic, future projections to entice stakeholders. Unfortunately, little is known about how skilled cultural founders generate hype to attract stakeholders. In our study, we examine how founders function as “skilled cultural operatives” to positively manipulate the emergence of hype. We conduct an experiment on 148 members of the media, and we find support for our theorizing in that founders who display their entrepreneurial abilities (swagger) combined with an authentic emotional commitment to the venture (passion), it increases media expectations (hype).
Executive summary
For the founders of innovative technologies, hype is not just beneficial, it is a strategic necessity. Hype is characterized by an overinflated interest in emerging technologies where future expectations outweigh current capabilities. It serves as a magnet for essential resources such as funding and customer interest. This dynamic, albeit critical, is often misunderstood and underestimated, in particular as regards the founder's role in its development. It is therefore of paramount importance to unravel the nuances of how founders contribute to the creation of hype.
This study explores founders as “skilled cultural operatives,” adept at using their cultural toolkit through sensegiving to inflate media expectations, thereby creating hype. Sensegiving in entrepreneurship involves a mix of verbal and non-verbal cues to communicate, clarify, and justify new technology. It is particularly important if there are no historical references or industry standards. The study posits that effective sensegiving through metaphorical reasoning, in which founders display their confidence and passion in a highly visible and expressive way, is key to generating media attention to generate hype.
In the present study, the concept of “swagger” emerged as a critical sensegiving mechanism. Defined as a conspicuous display of confidence through various expressions, swagger is a tool for founders to project their abilities and attract media coverage. However, this swagger, even if it attracts attention, may initially be perceived negatively, as a mere showmanship without substance. This research provides a nuanced understanding of this perception and shows that if swagger is infused with genuine passion, it transforms into a powerful catalyst for generating hype.
Conclusively, this study enriches the literature on hype cycles, moving beyond mere descriptions to a deeper understanding of how founders generate hype. By introducing and operationalizing the concept of entrepreneurial swagger, this study expands the range of sensegiving strategies available to founders. This study guides founders on how to effectively leverage swagger, demonstrating that when combined with passion, swagger can successfully generate hype and attract the necessary resources for innovative technologies.", November 2024,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

This paper examines how entrepreneurs manage temporal commitments associated with hyped audience expectations. We examine hype in the crowdfunding context, conducting an inductive study of 155 entrepreneur project updates from five new ventures that mobilized significant funding on Kickstarter. Entrepreneur updates were matched with 17,807 backer comments, creating call and response pairs. Using LIWC sentiment analysis, we tracked changes in backer negative tone over time and observed spikes and dips corresponding with temporal events. The pattern suggested that entrepreneurs have techniques to tamp down negative sentiment from backers as they delay product shipments. Through inductive examination of entrepreneur and backer interactions, we uncover entrepreneurs' use of four narrative practices to manage the temporal constraints of hyped audience expectations: frequent communication, evidence of progress, proximal temporal reach, and time-quality trade-off. While initially effective, these practices have diminishing returns over time, eventually triggering backer outrage as continual delays frustrate backers. We additionally find that the effectiveness of the narrative practices is influenced by external temporal pacers, with entrepreneurs using pacers to amplify narrative practice effectiveness, while backers use them as reasons to reject delays.", November 2024,"Entrepreneurial hype, Time, Temporality, Resource mobilization, Crowdfunding",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

In this paper, we draw from the theory of social and emotional aging to examine the mechanisms of age-related emotional exhaustion among entrepreneurs. Based on longitudinal data from a sample of 840 entrepreneurs in four European countries, our study shows that, with increasing biological age, entrepreneurs experience less emotional exhaustion due to their enhanced psychological capital and because they apply less 
entrepreneurial strategies
 which focus on the creation of new market opportunities and the development of new products and services. In addition, we highlight the still under-explored role of entrepreneurs' felt age gap by demonstrating that, among the same age-group, individuals who feel younger than their biological age gain well-being benefits because they possess higher levels of psychological capital and become less exhausted from the application of entrepreneurial strategies. In conclusion, our study offers two significant contributions to the literature on entrepreneurial well-being. First, we introduce the concept of the ‘Hebe Effect in entrepreneurship’, named after the Greek goddess of youth, which demonstrates how feeling younger than one's biological age acts as a buffer against stress and protects entrepreneurs from the strains of entrepreneurship. Second, we deepen understandings of how entrepreneurs' strategic choices evolve over their lifespan and influence their personal well-being. These insights also carry practical implications for 
aging societies
 that promote entrepreneurship across individuals' lifespans.
Executive summary
This study addresses a critical gap in the entrepreneurship literature on aging and well-being by examining how age influences emotional exhaustion among entrepreneurs. Despite significant research conducted on aging and entrepreneurship, studies have yet to explore the interplay between biological age, subjective age, and emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, the manner in which entrepreneurs subject themselves to, and protect themselves from, emotional exhaustion across their lifespans remains severely underexplored. This lacuna is particularly striking given global trends of increased life expectancy, the burgeoning number of older individuals engaging in entrepreneurship, and the risks posed by emotional exhaustion to entrepreneurial efforts and individuals' lives, as well as the societal costs related thereto.
By using the theory of social and emotional aging (SEA), we investigate how biological age and subjective age impact entrepreneurs' emotional exhaustion. Our 
longitudinal study
, based on data from 840 entrepreneurs across four European countries, reveals that older entrepreneurs experience less emotional exhaustion than their younger peers. This is due to their increased psychological capital and reduced engagement in strategies focused on new market opportunities and product development. Additionally, entrepreneurs who subjectively feel younger than their biological age benefit from higher psychological capital and are less affected by the emotional strain of entrepreneurial strategies.
Our research introduces the ‘Hebe Effect in entrepreneurship’, illustrating that feeling younger than one's biological age serves as a buffer against emotional exhaustion. This effect is mediated by enhanced psychological capital and the strategic choices made by entrepreneurs as they age. By developing and testing the novel Age-Strategy-PsyCap-Exhaustion (ASPE) model, we demonstrate how biological age and felt age gap jointly influence entrepreneurs' emotional exhaustion through psychological capital and strategic choices. The study makes significant contributions to both theory and practice. The concept of the Hebe Effect in entrepreneurship provides a new lens through which to understand how subjective age can protect entrepreneurs from emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, our ASPE model offers a comprehensive framework for explicating the mechanisms through which age-related factors impact entrepreneurial well-being.
From a practical perspective, our findings suggest important policy implications for aging societies. Encouraging entrepreneurship among older adults can yield well-being benefits and enhance resilience, thus underscoring the value of an inclusive approach to entrepreneurial support. In addition, specifically tailored support mechanisms that consider both biological and subjective aging can help mitigate emotional exhaustion, thereby fostering sustainable entrepreneurial activities across all ages. In conclusion, this study advances our understanding of the complex relationship between aging and entrepreneurial well-being, offering valuable insights for both academic research and practical applications in promoting a healthy and resilient form of entrepreneurship.", September 2024,"Entrepreneurship, Emotional exhaustion, Well-being, Aging, Age, Subjective age, Strategy, Psychological capital",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

The Internet has transformed economic activities in many important ways over the past two decades. This study examines the role of the Internet in narrowing the gender gap in entrepreneurship. Building on the assumptions that the Internet facilitates information transmission and breaks down information barriers for aspiring entrepreneurs, the study hypothesizes that (a) the Internet narrows the gender gap in the probability of entrepreneurship, and (b) the gender gap–mitigating effect of the Internet is stronger for the more disadvantaged members of society. These hypotheses are tested with six waves of data from the China Family Panel Studies, a nationally representative longitudinal survey series from 2010 to 2020. Empirical evidence based on the analysis of 25,177 individuals confirms that Internet use is associated with a narrower gender gap in entrepreneurship. In addition, the gender gap–mitigating effect of the Internet is stronger for less educated individuals and those who live in regions with a lower level of gender equality. The gender gap–mitigating effect of the Internet is also stronger for informal (rather than formal) entrepreneurship.

We analyse entrepreneurial entry along the dimensions of informal-formal and necessity-opportunity entrepreneurship, distinguishing between them yet considering them jointly. While the dominant view in the literature conflates necessity with informal entry, and opportunity with formal entry, we hypothesise that informal entrepreneurship may be attractive to higher-income individuals as a testing ground for entrepreneurial ideas. We also explain why higher-income individuals may undertake necessity entrepreneurship. We utilise individual Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data from Chile (2019–2021), which identifies informal-formal and necessity-opportunity entrepreneurial entry modes, to test hypotheses on the role of individuals´ income in the four types of entrepreneurial entry. We also consider changes in entrepreneurial entry during a crisis and a non-crisis periods. Our results confirm that the patterns in the data are consistent with hypotheses derived from our proposed theoretical framework.
Executive summary
Emerging markets economies have very large informal sectors, and their entrepreneurial entry is often motivated by economic necessity rather than by business opportunity. But neither informal nor necessity entrepreneurship are usually expected to generate the positive benefits for growth and development predicted for formal and opportunity entrepreneurship. We argue that the dominant stream in the literature actually conflates informal and necessity entrepreneurship, both of which have been associated with low human and financial capital and productivity. We propose that the appropriate typology is more complex than this because there are examples of successful and dynamic informal firms. This leads us to identify four categories of entrepreneurial entry: informal-necessity (Type 1), formal-opportunity (Type 2), informal-opportunity (Type 3), and formal-necessity (Type 4). While necessity entrepreneurship has typically been associated with low-income individuals, we propose that formal-necessity entrepreneurship may be an entry path for both low- and high-income individuals, though for different reasons. Informal opportunity entry may likewise be an option for people with low-income as well as high-income.
We therefore seek to disentangle the analysis of opportunity-necessity and of formal-informal entry and to demonstrate that the two less explored entry modes - informal-opportunity, and formal-necessity - are of considerable theoretical and practical significance in emerging economies. We test our framework in the emerging market economy setting of Chile, one of the more prosperous and open economies in Latin America. We use Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data which uniquely for Chile allow us to distinguish between individuals along both the formal-informal and the necessity-opportunity dimensions. On this basis, we distinguish empirically between these four categories of entrepreneurial entry and explain how higher-income individuals may use informal-opportunity entrepreneurial entry as a “seed bed” to test their new business ideas. At the same time, we show that necessity entrepreneurship may be attractive to both lower- and higher-income individuals.
We also show that the interplay between individuals´ income groups and four entrepreneurial entry modes is stable over “normal times” versus “crisis periods”. We observe that in response to a crisis, individuals with lower-incomes are likely to engage more in informal-necessity entrepreneurship while opportunity-informal entry by higher-income individuals will decline. These changes represent a more complex adjustment pattern than has been identified for developed economies, where 
entrepreneurial activity
 has been found to be countercyclical. Thus, in emerging markets, informal-necessity entrepreneurship plays a stabilizing role for those individuals with a more marginal position in the 
labor market
 during the crisis. In contrast, for those individuals who have access to higher household income, all forms of entrepreneurship become a less attractive option. We interpret this as indicating that these individuals have the option to wait for higher return opportunities to re-emerge. This is one of the first papers to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on entrepreneurship in an emerging market economy.", July 2024,"Informal entrepreneurship, Opportunity, Necessity, Income, Crisis, Global entrepreneurship monitor, Chile",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

We explore the concept of organizational hybridity from the perspective of the Judgment-Based Approach to entrepreneurship (JBA). The JBA provides much-needed 
microfoundations
 for hybridity in the form of a more nuanced, action-based view of the market mechanism in shaping 
enterprises
. Rather than a problem of conflicting logics at the organizational level, hybridity is redefined as entrepreneurial judgment at the individual level about combinations of monetary and psychic profit. Viewed this way, hybridity is a universal characteristic of real-world enterprises rather than a defining feature of a specific subset of them. This approach thus ultimately reshapes our understanding of hybridity and suggests an alternative view that is less conflictual and insular, and more conciliatory and integrated. It also sheds light on various problems facing such enterprises, including strategy formation, practical wisdom, normative pressures, mission drift, entrepreneurial groups, and public policy.
Executive summary
Hybrid enterprises are said to combine different logics or orientations within an organization. These logics are typically described as either economic or social, and are usually conceived as existing in inherent tension with each other; hence, hybrid enterprises are neither conventional monetary profit-seeking businesses nor purely social or charitable organizations, but some awkward, possibly paradoxical combination of both. The best-known and most frequently studied types of hybrids are social enterprises, which straddle the line between monetary profit-seeking and the pursuit of broader social goals or social value.
The literature on hybrids is growing rapidly, but to date there has been little agreement over its fundamental concepts and frameworks, and key questions remain about the origins, meaning, and development of hybrids. There is particular debate about whether the different “logics” of hybrids are necessarily in tension or conflict, or whether they exist harmoniously, as complements. Are hybrids just another form of profit-seeking market organization? As organizations, are they puzzles to solve, or perhaps paradoxes to confront? Answering these questions is crucial for understanding of what hybrids are, how they work, and what their broader implications are for economy and society.
We address to these debates by developing a new conceptual basis for studying hybrid enterprises. We argue that current controversies are usually the result of studying hybridity only at the organizational level. In response, we explore the microfoundations of hybridity, showing that what is called hybrid organizing simply reflects entrepreneurs' choices about how to pursue 
monetary profits
 and 
psychic profits
. Drawing on the Judgment-Based Approach to entrepreneurship (JBA), we show how entrepreneurial decision-making constantly negotiates the boundaries of monetary calculation and profit-seeking and alternative, non-monetary goals such as providing 
social benefits
. Understanding the interplay between the monetary and psychic profit leads to a more realistic and nuanced account of the causal foundations of hybridity, while also dispelling some confusions that have arisen in the literature. Ultimately, what is called hybridity at the organizational level is simply the result of 
entrepreneurial action
 at the individual level about combinations of profit.
This approach leads to several notable results. First, it emphasizes that all enterprises are to some extent social and contain elements of what is called hybridity. Second, as a result, microfoundations challenge the importance of hybridity as such as a key construct. What is called hybridity is not a defining characteristic of certain organizations, but exists in all enterprises, and is a persistent aspect of entrepreneurial decisions regarding how to organize and restructure firms. Third, a micro-level approach dissolves the perceived tension between different logics in the enterprise, promoting a view that is less conflictual and insular, and more conciliatory and integrated. Fourth, microfoundations can help connect meso- and macro- level research as a way of encouraging a more comprehensive research program that includes all sizes and shapes of enterprise. Fifth, they also shed light on various problems facing enterprises of all types, including strategy formation, practical wisdom, normative pressures, mission drift, entrepreneurial groups, and public policy.", July 2024,"Hybridity, Social enterprise, Judgment, Psychic profit, Strategy as simple rules",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

The primary purpose of this research is to examine the extent to which positioning hybrid ventures as more or less congruent with their category influences perceptions of their legitimacy. To do so, we first introduce and define the notion of a

 as an institutional context which combines two or more dominant institutional logics that both constrain and enable organizational action. We then construct a theoretical framework instantiated within a hybrid category, suggesting that moderate incongruence between a new venture's identity

 and the expectations most strongly associated with the category will positively influence perceived legitimacy. We further predict specific relationships among dimensions of perceived legitimacy, as well as their downstream effects on an individual's willingness to contribute resources. Across three studies in which we experimentally manipulate congruence with a hybrid category, we find a consistent pattern of support for our hypotheses and reveal a unique benefit for new hybrid ventures who position themselves in a manner that is moderately incongruent with the hybrid category.

Means-compatibility reflects the constraint entrepreneurs from marginalized groups encounter in market structures. We engage with these tensions in the context of the businesses, processes, and products that emerge from the entrepreneurship of marginalized groups. We use these tensions to derive propositions that speak to the likelihood emancipatory opportunities develop and that these opportunities are exploited by marginalized groups. With these propositions, we contribute to debates about entrepreneurship's overall emancipatory capacity. Specifically, we contribute a conceptual space in which the market forces that structure

This study examines the impact of mandatory legal form choices on startups' debt financing opportunities. We posit that an entrepreneur's initial legal form decision serves as a reliable signal to outside lenders, reducing adverse selection concerns. Using data from German startups, we find that 
limited liability companies
 with low capital requirements disproportionately secure less debt than their high-capital counterparts. This financing disparity is particularly pronounced for younger firms in areas dominated by small relationship banks, but it diminishes with firm age. Our findings highlight the unintended consequences of recent global deregulation efforts.
Executive summary
Formal debt financing is arguably the most important source of external financing for startups. Despite its importance, many startups find it challenging to secure such financing due to informational opacity: they lack the track record or publicly available evidence needed to prove that they are a sound investment. This raises a pressing question: How can startups credibly convey their creditworthiness to potential lenders?
We posit that a startup entrepreneur's choice of legal form acts as a pivotal signal to potential lenders, allowing them to differentiate between high-risk and low-risk ventures. Every startup must decide what legal form it will adopt at incorporation. Unlike most other, industry-specific decisions, the choice of legal form acts as a consistent and universally applicable signal. Moreover, recent shifts in global regulations have seen the emergence of companies with low-capital legal forms, a development further underscoring the importance of studying these choices (World Bank, 2020).
We theorize that adopting a legal form with high minimum paid-in capital requirements signals that a venture will be less likely to default on a loan: entrepreneurs who anticipate a higher likelihood of default will be less inclined to pick a legal form with high minimum capital requirements since they would be liable for the amount of paid-in capital in the case of 
bankruptcy
. The opportunity costs of such a choice would also be higher as founding a high-capital firm would entail foregoing alternative, safer investment opportunities. Furthermore, the reputational costs and potential stigma of failure associated with defaulting when choosing a high- versus low-capital legal form may induce high-risk types to choose the latter. Importantly, we posit that the legal form choice has signaling value beyond the amount of paid-in capital: among firms with the same amount of equity and similar firm and founder characteristics, those ventures with a low-capital legal form have more difficulty in attracting the necessary external funding.
We utilize comprehensive administrative and survey data from German firms to empirically test our hypotheses. In 2008, Germany introduced the “mini-LLC” or “low-capital LLC,” allowing founders to opt for a lower minimum capital requirement than the traditional 25,000 Euro. This shift presented a unique opportunity to study the implications of legal form choice on external financing. Our findings suggest that low-capital LLCs typically secure less debt and more frequently experience financial constraints, despite the lack of any significant difference between their financing needs and those of high-capital LLCs. We further demonstrate that the total effect consists of a mild positive intentional impact from choosing a high-capital legal form and a strong negative unintentional impact from opting for a low-capital form.
Notably, these signaling effects are more pronounced for smaller, “relationship banks,” which tend to rely more on nonfinancial cues for risk assessment due to their limited access to sophisticated financial evaluation tools. As the firm-bank relationship matures, the weight of this signal diminishes, indicating that banks adjust their assessment based on acquired knowledge of the firm's quality. However, larger, “transactional banks,” which focus more on hard data, tend to maintain their reliance on this signal for extended periods.
For entrepreneurs, the key takeaway is that a trade-off exists between capital requirements and debt accessibility. The stigma tied to low-capital legal forms disproportionately affects their ability to secure debt. Opting for a legal form with low capital requirements might be advantageous to those not heavily dependent on external financing in the early stages, and fostering long-standing relationships with banks is one way of mitigating the unintended consequences of choosing a low-capital legal structure. Entrepreneurs should consider the prevalent banking landscape in their regions; in areas dominated by smaller banks, the legal form choice is especially crucial.
For policymakers, the implications are clear. Regulations regarding firm incorporation can unintentionally impact startups' access to external funding, potentially stifling growth. Understanding these dynamics when formulating policies that shape the entrepreneurial landscape is essential.", May 2024,"D80, G30, M48",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

In many informal economies, entrepreneurs face a visibility paradox: increasing visibility to resource-granting stakeholders simultaneously increases exposure to resource-extracting stakeholders. To investigate this phenomenon, we leverage a unique, hand-collected, small-area census dataset of firms in the township of Delft in Cape Town, South Africa, providing rare insight into a population of otherwise unobserved firms. Through an abductive, multimethod approach, we address three interrelated research questions: (i) How do informal economy entrepreneurs make their firms visible? (ii) Which informal economy entrepreneurs make their firms visible? (iii) How does firm visibility relate to firm performance? Our analysis identifies distinct dimensions of authority- and community-oriented visibility and introduces the concept of 
selective visibility
, which refers to making a firm visible to certain stakeholders (e.g., community members) but not others (e.g., authorities). Using a 
social embeddedness

The QCA results also indicate a configurational relationship such that visibility's association with performance varies with an entrepreneur's level of embeddedness. As a whole, our study builds theory regarding the taken-for-granted concept of firm visibility and provides important insights that are generative for entrepreneurship research in informal economies and other difficult-to-access settings.", March 2024,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Crises have significant implications for entrepreneurs' businesses. Female entrepreneurs are often found to suffer from crises due to their marginalized positions. Despite the increasing research at the nexus of crisis, entrepreneurship, and gender, how a crisis may influence investors' funding decisions concerning female entrepreneurs and whether different macro crises bring with them different implications remain under-explored questions. Drawing on role 
congruity theory
 and the crisis and strategic decision-making literature, this paper proposes that macro crises can shake the perceived incongruity between traditional stereotypes of the female gender role and masculine stereotypes related to the entrepreneur's role, thereby affecting financing for female entrepreneurs. We further compare two specific crises having different associated implications: the global financial crisis (GFC) and the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted two studies, one emphasizing experimental manipulation and the second based on observational data. We found consistent evidence that investors were more likely to invest in female-founded ventures after the GFC; however, the opposite phenomenon occurred after COVID-19. Our experiment demonstrates that changed perceptions of gender role incongruity are a critical underlying mechanism driving our results. Our research has implications for both the entrepreneurship literature and role 
congruity theory
.
Executive summary
Amidst the expanding body of research on crisis, entrepreneurship, and gender, there is a predominant focus on the entrepreneur, leaving a discernible gap in our understanding of how macro-level crises specifically influence investors' funding decisions related to female entrepreneurs, and whether different types of crises lead to varying outcomes. This paper aims to bridge this gap, drawing insights from role congruity theory and integrating perspectives from crisis and strategic decision-making literature. We suggest that macro crises have the potential to shift investors' perceived incongruities between female gender roles and the masculine stereotypes commonly associated with entrepreneur roles, consequently affecting funding decisions for female-founded ventures.
To test our hypothesis, we conducted two comprehensive studies within the contexts of two different crises, each with unique implications: the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our first study employed experimental manipulation, while the second relied on observational data. Across both studies, the results were consistent: post-GFC, investors demonstrated an increased propensity to invest in female-founded ventures; conversely, after the onset of COVID-19, this trend reversed. Crucially, our findings underscore the pivotal role of perceptions of gender role incongruity in shaping the observed outcomes.
Our framework enriches the existing body of literature, offering nuanced insights into how various crises may impact investors' funding decisions based on gender. Moreover, our results underscore the importance of aligning actions with macro-level shifts as we strive to cultivate more inclusive

We examine how external endorsements help new ventures with varying degrees of innovativeness to attract funding. According to optimal distinctiveness theory, new ventures should be as different from competitors as legitimately possible. However, initial research suggests that new ventures can also buffer their legitimacy through external endorsements. We clarify that effects of such legitimacy buffers depend critically on an audience's unique legitimacy-distinctiveness relationship. Specifically, external endorsements lead to different predictions about shifts in optimal distinctiveness for return-seeking audiences compared to novelty-seeking audiences as relevant new venture funders. For return-seeking audiences, new ventures are perceived as less legitimate when they are non-innovative or radically innovative so that incrementally innovative new ventures are most attractive without endorsements. External endorsements can thus buffer the legitimacy of non-innovative and radically innovative new ventures, but they lead to different performance implications for a return-seeking audience. While non-innovative new ventures increase their attractiveness, only radically innovative new ventures can become optimally distinctive and outperform other distinctiveness configurations. In contrast, novelty-seeking audiences already have a higher tolerance for radically innovative new ventures, so the effects of external endorsements are less pronounced. Four empirical studies, using observational data and experiments in equity and reward-based crowdfunding, provide strong support for this theory and account for alternative explanations such as risk perceptions. In turn, we shed new light on the crucial, audience-specific function of external endorsements, namely, as a means to alter optimal distinctiveness levels.", January 2024,"Innovation, Endorsements, Optimal distinctiveness, Legitimacy, Equity crowdfunding, Entrepreneurship, Reward crowdfunding, Resource acquisition",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Our results extend the sustainable entrepreneurship literature by showing how the

Executive summary
Why do entrepreneurs in some countries engage in more climate change adaptation (CCA) intellectual property (IP) protection than others? We postulate that entrepreneurs' attention is simultaneously situated in their country's climatic and institutional environments, and that these contexts shape the salience of CCA IP protection. Formally, we predict that entrepreneurs who would normally deprioritize CCA IP protection as an opportunity in the face of more urgent socioeconomic issues become more attuned to it as their country's climate impact increases. We then theorize institutional conditions that influence entrepreneurs' responsiveness to climate impact. First, we predict that stronger 
intellectual property rights
 institutions reduce entrepreneurs' uncertainty in capturing rents from their CCA IP and hence strengthen the relationship between climate impact and CCA IP protection. Second, we predict that informal institutions aligned with environmental movements increase the salience of climate impacts to corporate entrepreneurs by spurring their interests in 
environmental issues
 and hence also strengthen the climate impact-CCA IP protection relationship. Our empirical analyses using 689 country-year observations consisting of 95 countries over the period 2005 to 2015 reveal that country-level climate impact drives CCA IP protection, especially when there are strong

This study introduces the novel construct of bridge-economy partners, which can assist Western firms in learning how to collaborate with local partners when entering unfamiliar foreign countries that have substantially different socioeconomic characteristics. We offer initial empirical evidence regarding the relevance of establishing such interorganizational partnership triads among Western, bridge-economy, and local firms for the entries of Western venture capital firms (VCs) into Mainland China between 1997 and 2008. Venture age, regional legal maturity, and the Western VCs' accumulated local experience are identified as relevant contingency factors for the likelihood of adopting this type of collaboration, which involves partners from three different types of economies. We supplement our quantitative analyses with anecdotal qualitative evidence from interviews with VC executives and fund managers.
Executive summary
This study introduces the novel construct of bridge-economy partners and outlines their potentially beneficial roles in the context of foreign-market entry undertaken by Western firms. The established literature suggests that Western firms consider collaboration with a local firm as an accelerator for learning about and adapting to local conditions. However, the substantial socioeconomic differences that may exist between home and host country can create paramount challenges for collaborations between Western firms and their local partners. Adding a third type of partner from a country with substantial socioeconomic overlap to both firms' home countries can help “bridge the socioeconomic gap” between Western and local firms. The bridge-economy partners can assist Western firms in learning how to collaborate with their new local partners.
This study offers initial empirical evidence for the relevance of such interorganizational partnership triads between Western, bridge-economy, and local firms by using the data of Western VC firms and their entries into Mainland China between 1997 and 2008. Venture age, regional legal maturity, and accumulated local experience of Western VCs are identified as relevant contingency factors for the likelihood of adopting this type of triadic interorganizational partnership. Quantitative hypothesis tests are supplemented with anecdotal qualitative evidence.
Reported findings extend the emerging entrepreneurship literature that focuses on foreign-market entry and globalization. Our focus on triadic partnerships and the role of bridge-economy firms extends the previous research that has instead nearly exclusively focused on dyadic collaborations between Western firms and local partners. A triadic Western, bride-economy, and local firms (WBL) partnership offers an alternative strategy to use when entering foreign markets that have substantially different cultural, economic, and institutional characteristics. Our findings further highlight that even though such triadic WBL partnerships make intuitive sense, successfully implementing such complex collaborations requires minimum levels of accumulated host-country experiences and can benefit from mature legal environments. For policymakers in emerging economies that are interested in supporting foreign investment, the creation of legal environments conducive to forming such triadic WBL collaborations introduces a promising policy option. Beyond these initial key insights, this study also provides guidance for systematic future research into this promising type of collaboration for foreign market entry.", January 2024,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

However, these benefits wane as age perceptions increase, and age perceptions eventually become detrimental to funding efforts, resulting in an inverted-U relationship between age perceptions and funding evaluations.

The growing phenomenon of highly valued startups (e.g., unicorns) poses fundamental questions for entrepreneurship research. We posit that venture scalability and VC funding availability may explain startups' IPO valuations (and timing). Highly scalable ventures may not only capture very large market opportunities, but their scaling strategies may also be constrained by the governance and regulatory burdens faced by public firms. Accordingly, we hypothesize and find that more scalable ventures undertake IPOs at higher valuations, which is positively moderated by VC funding availability.

Prior research shows that childcare is a unique driver for female entrepreneurship, as entrepreneurship allows women to increase time allocation on child supervision. Yet, whether female entrepreneurship actually promotes 
childrearing
 outcomes remains contentious in extant literature. This study focuses on child 
human capital formation
 as a key childrearing outcome. Drawing on the occupational inheritance literature, we suggest that, in addition to supervision, entrepreneur-mothers may foster child human capital formation through value transmission—in particular, transmitting self-direction values to children. Using nationally representative data from China, we find that children with entrepreneur-mothers exhibit better human capital formation outcomes—especially when they are younger and female. We further show that both supervision and value transmission are present, with the latter being a more important mechanism. Reconciling conflicting views in the literature, our study has both theoretical and practical implications.
Executive summary
Prior female entrepreneurship research suggests that women often choose to be entrepreneurs out of family, particularly childrearing, considerations. Entrepreneurship offers work 
autonomy
 and scheduling flexibility, allowing entrepreneur-mothers to better allocate time to childrearing activities. Given that numerous studies document a positive relationship between maternal time allocation and childrearing outcomes, conceivably entrepreneur-mothers should achieve favorable childrearing outcomes. Entrepreneurial research focusing on the business-family interface, however, suggests female entrepreneurs often face unanticipated pressures that limit their ability to care for family members. In addition, some female entrepreneurs may be motivated more by career than by childcare considerations. As such, the relationship between female entrepreneurship and childrearing outcomes remains conceptually and empirically ambiguous. Given the foregoing situation, we examine this relationship both theoretically and empirically, focusing on child human capital formation as a specific and important childrearing outcome.
Examining how female entrepreneurship relates to child human capital formation is of both scholarly and practical importance. First, it brings enhanced clarity to our understanding of the family- and child-related consequences of female entrepreneurship, thus affording reconciliation of the ambiguous predictions found in extant theories. Accordingly, we advance research on female entrepreneurship. Exploring the relationship also adds to the family embeddedness perspective in the broader entrepreneurship literature, because child development is a crucial component within the family domain.
Second, our research has practical values and policy implications. Prospective female entrepreneurs may, regardless of their pre-entry intentions, be interested in learning how entering entrepreneurship could affect childrearing outcomes. Policymakers worldwide have been actively promoting entrepreneurship in the past few decades, mainly driven by economic and technological considerations. Because such efforts likely increase female participation in 
entrepreneurial activities
, they should be evaluated to account for their family or childrearing consequences in addition to the economic and technological implications. Therefore, we provide evidence which prospective female entrepreneurs and policymakers can use to make informed decisions.
To study the effect of female entrepreneurship on child human capital formation, we note that the ambiguous predictions in extant work arise because it predominantly focuses on whether entrepreneur-mothers can allocate more time to childrearing activities, which we call “supervision”. We suggest that this supervision mechanism is not the only way in which the intergenerational impact occurs. Drawing on 
sociological research
 in occupational inheritance, we propose that entrepreneur-mothers could foster child human capital formation through transmitting self-direction values, thus promoting children's aspirations and achievements. To test these theoretical hypotheses, we use data from a nationally representative Chinese household survey, which contains separately surveyed parent and child data.
Our empirical analyses reveal that children with entrepreneur-mothers outperform those with non-entrepreneur-mothers in both cognitive and noncognitive skills. The effect is stronger for daughters and 
younger children
. Additional analyses verify the presence of both supervision and value transmission mechanisms, with value transmission being more importantly in explaining the entrepreneur-mother effect.
Findings in this study deepen our knowledge on whether and how entrepreneur-mothers foster children's human capital formation. They highlight that—in addition to supervision—value transmission is a crucial channel through which entrepreneur-mothers exert an intergenerational impact on children. Our results also indicate that women running larger businesses—likely those with career motives and targets of policies that promote entrepreneurship—see better child human capital formation outcomes despite having potentially limited supervision capacity. Finally, our findings not only shed light on female entrepreneurship in China, a context with growing relevance in the global economy and rate of entrepreneurial activities, but also offer generalizable insights to other economies.", November 2023,"Female entrepreneurship, Child human capital formation, Childrearing, Family embeddedness perspective, Value transmission",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

This study addresses entrepreneurs as targets of crime. Leveraging insights from strategic responses to institutional pressures as the main theoretical frame, coupled with supporting insights from 
routine activities theory
 and interview data from 14 entrepreneurs who have been victims of crime, we introduce entrepreneur-led ventures becoming targets of crime via their engagement in routine activities that increase venture visibility. We then conceptualize that crime severity pushes entrepreneurs toward venture visibility-reduction responses, such as truncating growth, relocating, or discontinuing the venture. Survey data from 87,486 legally registered entrepreneur-led ventures in 
Mexico
 provide strong support for the relationships in our theoretical model. We find that as routine venture activities increase, entrepreneurs encounter crime of increasing severity, with the routine venture activity of making transactions at a bank serving as the strongest attractor of crime. Building on these findings, we observe an indirect effect through crime severity such that the choice to relocate the venture is the most likely response to being targeted by criminals. Our results advance the literature at the intersection of crime and entrepreneurship, especially in developing economies, and offers venture visibility as a mechanism that shapes both criminals' targeting of ventures and entrepreneurs' attempts to reduce being targeted.", November 2023,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

We test a general model of career mobility and entrepreneurship based on the premise that job transitions between organizations are influenced by the unique role of the organizational founder. Three related ideas inform our inquiry. First, individuals in that role are endowed with the right to act as representatives of their organizations which increases commitment and deters external mobility. Second, the founder role, because of its uniqueness, defines how entrepreneurs think of themselves thus aligning person and position. Repeat entrepreneurship occurs because after a founder leaves, this alignment is disrupted and the need to restore it leads to becoming a founder again. Third, we see the founder role as imbued with charismatic authority. This creates an aura of deference and a propensity to emulate the founder that inspires organizational members working alongside the founder to themselves become entrepreneurs. We investigate these ideas empirically in the context of the global high-end fashion industry through a research design that allows us to compare leading designers' career histories as both founders and members and their transitions to and out of entrepreneurship.", September 2023,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Recent literature suggests entrepreneurs struggle to pivot—or fundamentally change aspects of their venture—due to identity-based resistance to change. Yet, when entrepreneurs receive negative feedback, overcoming this resistance may be important to pivoting their business model. We adopt a convergent, 
mixed methods
 research design to explore when and why some entrepreneurs overcome resistance to change in response to negative feedback during early-stage business model experimentation. Building upon qualitative data that we gathered and analyzed, we theorize entrepreneurs may resist pivoting their value proposition relative to other business model components despite receiving negative feedback on this aspect of their business model. However, we find three factors – 
entrepreneurial experience
, startup mentoring, and team size – may enable entrepreneurs to pivot in response to negative feedback. We theorize that these factors broaden a startup team's perspective, enabling value proposition pivoting during early-stage business model experimentation. We test these relationships with quantitative data from 80 startups engaged in business model experimentation and find support across hypotheses. We contribute to understanding when and why entrepreneurs pivot aspects of their business models in response to negative feedback during early-stage business model experimentation.
Executive summary
The entrepreneurship literature suggests startups may benefit from experimentation and pivoting different parts of their business model in response to negative feedback from stakeholders (Andries et al., 2021; Camuffo et al., 2020; Shepherd and Gruber, 2021). In early stages of starting a new venture, a business model refers to a cognitive schema or belief about an activity system that could potentially create and capture value (Massa et al., 2017; Shepherd and Gruber, 2021). Business model experimentation is the process of testing assumptions underlying this potential business model and pivoting business model assumptions in response to negative feedback (Andries et al., 2013; McDonald and Eisenhardt, 2020; Leatherbee and Katila, 2020). Building upon prior literature, we define 
business model pivoting
 as a fundamental change to parts of the business model (Berends et al., 2021; Snihur and Clarysse, 2022; Shepherd and Gruber, 2021). Yet, literature also suggests founders often struggle to pivot assumptions despite negative feedback. Motives to preserve and protect certain assumptions relevant to founders' identities can interfere with pivoting (Grimes, 2018; Kirtley and O'Mahony, 2023; Zuzul and Tripsas, 2020). Despite the general understanding that founders struggle to change their ideas, however, the entrepreneurship literature currently lacks precise insight into when and why founders can overcome resistance to pivoting.
In this research, we explore when and why startups pivot different parts of their business model. We do so within the context of early-stage business model experimentation, where founders explicitly state assumptions about different parts of their potential business model, test those assumptions against stakeholder feedback, and are encouraged to pivot business model components in response to negative feedback. Through a 
mixed methods research design
, we find (1) founders tend to resist pivoting their value propositions relative to other parts of a business model in response to negative feedback; and (2) 
entrepreneurial experience
, startup mentoring, and team size enables startups to overcome this resistance to pivoting in response to negative feedback. We theorize these factors broaden founders' perspectives (Warshay, 1962), contributing to a greater willingness to pivot during experimentation.
We contribute to the literature on entrepreneurial pivoting by explaining nuanced variation in pivoting distinct business model components during experimentation. This contribution is important because it reveals that resistance to pivoting the business model may be more complex than previously thought. We also contribute to the literature at the nexus of business model experimentation and entrepreneurial cognition by finding that entrepreneurial experience, startup mentoring, and team size enable startups to pivot despite psychological resistance to pivoting in response to negative feedback because it broadens founders' perspectives. This insight is important theoretically because it advances what we know about enabling experimenting with business models under conditions of uncertainty. The research presented here has clear and important implications for practice. This research suggests founders often resist changing the value proposition versus other components of their business models in early stages of venture development. This resistance can impede experimentation and pivoting in response to negative feedback. To the extent founders want to broaden their perspective to enable pivoting their value propositions in response to negative feedback during early stages of venture development, our data suggest they may be able to do so by recruiting members with entrepreneurial experience on their team (or gain entrepreneurial experience themselves), engage frequently with startup mentors, and increase the size of their team. Overall, we view the breath of perspective that comes from experience and interactions with others as an advantage for entrepreneurs when experimenting with their business models during early stages of venture development.", July 2023,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Particularly unique to our study is that we identify three scaling-specific paths through which the role-crafting of joiners shapes founders' roles. Specifically, founders experience a role efficiency increase as they take over some of the joiner-introduced role behaviors, or a role set decrease as joiners take over some of their (formal or informal) roles. We further point to the importance of psychological safety and value fit for successful joiner role-crafting to occur and for founder roles to change following founder-joiner interactions.

Entrepreneurial action
 only rarely results in the full transition to venture creation. Yet, extant research has focused almost exclusively on explaining how entrepreneurial action influences venture performance outcomes such as emergence and growth. Therefore, to advance theory, there is a need to uncover other outcomes of entrepreneurial action by decoupling it from venture creation. In this study, we begin such decoupling by exploring how entrepreneurial action can create individual benefits irrespective of venture emergence and financial success. We collected longitudinal data from a group of individuals who, due to forced migration, experienced significant disruption and then engaged in entrepreneurial action with the general goal of adapting to a new (to them) context. From this data, we integrated theory on entrepreneuring to develop a grounded model of post-disruption entrepreneuring. This model has three main components: (a) 
disruption assessment impact
—interpretation of how the disruption will influence one's ability to pursue tasks and goals that provide meaning in life; (b) 
use of entrepreneuring
—function and application of entrepreneuring activities in addressing opportunities or threats; and (c) 
projected goals
—anticipated outcomes that provide meaning, motivation, and purpose. These attempts at assessing the contextual conditions provide individuals with an objective way of framing their situation. Thus, entrepreneuring can serve as an accessible mental structure that facilitates adaptation. In elaborating on post-disruption entrepreneuring, this study contributes to the literature by demonstrating the generative capacity of entrepreneurial action even in the absence of venture creation.", May 2023,"Entrepreneuring, Disruption, Entrepreneurial action, Individual outcomes, Rewards",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Although organizational mission is central to social venturing, little is known about the nature and origins of social ventures' missions. In particular, the field lacks a framework for understanding the moral content of nascent ventures' “prosocial” missions that rely on quite different—and potentially conflicting—moral values. We engage in an exploratory study, drawing on moral foundations theory and upper echelons theory to develop framing questions related to the moral discourse in social venture missions and the role of founders' 
political ideology
 in relation to this moral discourse. We construct a novel dataset using computer-aided text analysis on the mission statements of over 50,000 nascent nonprofit ventures in the United States, supplemented by voter registration data from 17 states and Washington, D.C. Our findings reveal rich nuance in the moral discourse found in organizations' mission statements. Furthermore, founding teams' political ideologies are strongly associated with the moral discourse in their social ventures' stated missions—and in ways that differ intriguingly from findings in moral psychology at the individual level. We draw on these new insights to develop a roadmap for future research on organizational mission in relation to social venturing, moral markets, mission drift, and

Cognitive diversity directly influences the founding team's production of cultural information by shaping the diversity of the information set and the speed of its production. Moreover, cognitive diversity can give rise to faultlines within the venture, impacting how venture members interpret cultural information.

The entrepreneurship literature has advanced our understanding of how natural disasters affect new venture founding in their wake. However, despite providing valuable insights, most existing studies focus on theoretical mechanisms that, explicitly or implicitly, invoke material losses or do not hone in on the theoretical effect of human losses caused by these events. This is an important omission because the social psychology literature suggests that individual reactions to human death are not only stronger than (i.e., higher in scale), but qualitatively different (i.e., 
infinitely stronger
) from, those involving other types of losses. The present study addresses this oversight by drawing from the social psychology literature on the emotive and cognitive heuristics (e.g., the incidental emotion and availability biases) induced by human death and developing and testing a theory of how the death toll caused by natural disasters decreases new venture founding by inducing irresolvable uncertainty. Moreover, the study draws from research on how strong pre-disaster local participation in voluntary associations—by increasing the social, symbolic, cultural and material resources in a community—protects against such negative effects. Contributions to both the post-disaster venturing and the broader resiliency literatures are discussed.
Executive summary
Natural disasters are on the rise, and the United Nations predicts that these phenomena will pose the single most important threat to social, political and economic stability in the upcoming decades. Entrepreneurship holds great promise for helping regions recover from the havoc wreaked by these events. However, much of the existing entrepreneurship research has not focused sufficiently on how the human death toll caused by natural disasters affects subsequent new venture creation. This is an important question because the existing psychology literature suggests that human death elicits disproportionately high negative individual reactions, which may lead prospective entrepreneurs in afflicted regions to stop or delay their plans to start new ventures, precisely at the time when those ventures are needed the most to help with regional recovery. This study fills this gap by examining how the death toll caused by natural disasters affect new venture creation in counties in the United States between 1991 and 2018. The study finds that the death toll caused by natural disasters in a county has a negative effect on post-disaster venturing in that county, but that strong pre-disaster participation in voluntary associations (e.g., the Girl Scouts, parent teacher associations, etc.) protects against this effect because it allows communities to work together to overcome the challenges posed by these deadly events. This last result highlights the importance that policymakers at every government level and local communities realize the critical role that local participation in voluntary associations prior to deadly disasters can have in fostering entrepreneurship after such events, thereby accelerating regional recovery.", March 2023,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

The

 literature has linked childhood adversities to detrimental development outcomes that can undermine

In contrast, emerging entrepreneurship studies raise the possibility that childhood adversities may positively affect entrepreneurial action with some diverging findings. We reconcile these opposing theoretical perspectives in their effects on entrepreneurial entry by theorizing that childhood adversities are a mixed blessing for entrepreneurship and affect entry through two countervailing theoretical mechanisms. Childhood adversities increase the likelihood of entrepreneurial entry by promoting rule-breaking tendency and simultaneously decrease the likelihood of entry by negatively impacting individual ability (self-efficacy and educational attainment). We further theorized that childhood adversities have different implications for different types of entrepreneurial entry (incorporated and unincorporated) and for men versus women. We tested our hypotheses on a longitudinal sample of 4222 individuals from the NLSY79 child and young adult cohort data, which tracks the development of children born to a representative sample of U.S. young women from childhood through youth to adulthood.

Crime is an anti-social blight on communities that increases the cost of doing business, including for entrepreneurs. Drawing on Australian longitudinal data, this study examines the links between crime rates and the propensity for entrepreneurship within communities. We do so by matching propensity for entrepreneurship with types of crime found at the community level where crime occurs. We find that higher total crime rates, crimes against the person and property crime, significantly lower the propensity for entrepreneurship in communities. We also show that the core facets of community social capital – trust, membership in voluntary organizations and support and cooperation – mediate this relationship.
Executive summary
We comprehensively examine whether higher community crime rates – crime on people and crime on property – cause lower rates of entrepreneurship.
 Entrepreneurship research extensively examines how gaining social capital, defined as the social resources one gains within one's community, promotes entrepreneurship. This study considers whether a pervasive community dynamic in crime impedes entrepreneurship. Specifically, we show that the two main kinds of crime – people and property – inhibit entrepreneurship.
We show the facets of community social capital that mediate the relationship between crime and entrepreneurship.
 We inform the role of community-based social capital in promoting entrepreneurship (Kwon et al., 2013) by considering how higher crime lowers social capital and in turn entrepreneurship. We show that core facets of relational social capital – trust, voluntary membership in community bodies, support, and cooperation – mediate the relationship between crime and entrepreneurship. Likewise, communities with more robust reserves of social capital are better able to withstand crime and promote entrepreneurship.
Examining the link between crime and entrepreneurship allows us to contribute to the literature on entrepreneurship and social capital.
 We discuss the various ways in which crime diminishes social capital to shape entrepreneurship. In our framework that is predicated on theory on community social capital, crime creates distrust because it causes citizens to be wearier and more suspicious of each other, impeding sharing of ideas and knowledge for ventures. Crime impedes the efficacy and membership of community-based organizations that allow entrepreneurs to network. Crime reduces the support available for founders to start and sustain businesses in focal communities, as individuals seek opportunities and resources outside their communities. Crime diminishes the extent to which people take pride in and identify with their communities, as evidenced by voluntary membership in community organizations. Crime reduces collaboration because it leads to self-protective behaviors, including flight from high-crime communities, that hinder norms of reciprocity. Crime reduces cooperation as criminals are more likely to resort to coercion, as enforced by monitoring and violence, to solve business problems.
Findings rely on a comprehensive database of crime rates across Australian postcodes.
 Crime is typically a localized phenomenon – it affects business outcomes in local communities. We obtain community-level crime rates from each Australian state and 
territory
 police force or relevant government agencies and match these data with entrepreneurship rates by postcode. Our primary identification strategy follows Dustmann and Fasani (2016), who estimate the effect of local area crime on mental health in the United Kingdom (UK). This identification strategy removes the effects of residential sorting and correlates crime with time-varying unobserved entrepreneurship determinants if there is no endogenous migration from local crime. The main findings are robust to instrumenting for local area crime to which movers are exposed and for historical abortion rates in the state or 
territory
 where the individual lives, as well as a number of other approaches to obtaining causal inference.
The article holds considerable practical relevance for policymakers seeking to promote community entrepreneurship
. Our study is highly relevant to community leaders and policymakers working to boost local entrepreneurship. Findings strongly suggest that efforts to reduce crime are a primary mechanism to protect social capital within communities and, therefore, entrepreneurship. Policy initiatives dedicated to creating and expanding social ventures would a) boost entrepreneurship and social capital and b) mitigate the detrimental effects of crime on entrepreneurship (Wry and York, 2017).", March 2023,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

While most participants benefit from action-oriented entrepreneurship training, such programs can paradoxically also have negative effects. Training programs in which participants actively engage in entrepreneurship involve facing problems that might be too difficult to overcome, potentially decreasing trainees' entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Based on theories of self-regulation, we argue that error mastery orientation is a factor that explains under which condition problems do or do not lead to decreases in entrepreneurial self-efficacy during training. To test our model, we conducted a 12-week action-oriented training program and applied a longitudinal design with one 
baseline measurement
, seven measurements during training, and one measurement after training. Analyses based on 415 lagged observations from 109 training participants indicated that participants with low error mastery orientation experienced decreases in entrepreneurial self-efficacy during training when facing problems. In contrast, participants high in error mastery orientation could buffer the negative effects of problems on entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Our results suggest that error mastery orientation is a critical factor to understand why participants' episodic experiences of problems during training negatively influence their entrepreneurial self-efficacy.

To facilitate that conversation, we identify who unconventional entrepreneurs are; identify obstacles to a common theoretical conversation and how these obstacles could be overcome; outline a set of common theoretical themes that apply across various groups of unconventional entrepreneurs; and show how further theorizing unconventional entrepreneurs could challenge the community to reach beyond our existing knowledge horizons to develop pioneering entrepreneurship research.", January 2023,"Inclusion, Unconventional entrepreneurs, Underdog entrepreneurs, Inclusive entrepreneurship",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

We leverage this to describe how enforcement imperfections and heterogeneous rule interpretations give rise to the possibility of ‘black market’ and ‘gray market’ entrepreneurial actions. In turn, we theorize how actors' knowledge and motivations can lead them to identify and exploit breakable rule conditions via the creation of new ventures.

We examine how market overlap with parent organizations impacts the performance of startups founded by the former employees of these incumbent firms. Building on knowledge inheritance and competitive dynamics theories, we propose that the degree to which the operating markets of spinouts overlap with their parent organizations has a curvilinear relationship with their likelihood of survival. Market overlap is beneficial to spinouts because it reduces uncertainty during the early stages of new venture development. However, substantial market overlap may spark hostile actions by the parent organizations, thereby creating disruptive competition that may lower the likelihood of spinouts' survival. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the previous hierarchical position of founders in parent organizations moderates the overlap–performance relationship.

 alone rarely achieve a positive impact without the engagement of communities. To date, however, entrepreneurship researchers have tended to overlook the importance of community for creating

systematic review

Regional Science

societal impact
 is created by entrepreneurship 
for, in, with, enabled by,
 and 
driven by
 communities. Second, it demonstrates that the key to understanding how community relates to 
societal impact
 creation is to jointly account for both its type(s) and role(s). By linking community types and roles, the findings also suggest a theoretical contribution based on the relationship between the degree of formalization of a community type, and the degree of agency that a community role enacts. Third, the review underscores that communities are not just static settings but can also be dynamic actors in efforts to use entrepreneurship to create societal impact. Our cross-disciplinary review highlights trends and gaps in the extant literature and provides researchers with an evidence-based research agenda to guide future inquiry on this vital topic.", September 2022,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Venture capital is a socially embedded business where VCs refer investment opportunities to one another. While we know that these referrals increase the chances of a start-up passing the initial screening process, we investigate to what extent the intensity of relational

We introduce a new model to address three methodological biases in research on new venture growth and survival. The model offers entrepreneurship scholars numerous benefits. The biases are identified using a 
systematic review
 of 96 papers using longitudinal data published over a period of 20 years. They are: (1) distributional properties of new ventures; (2) selection bias; and (3) causal asymmetry. The biases make the popular use of normal distribution models problematic. As a potential solution, we introduce and test an event magnitude regression model approach (EMM). In this two-stage model, the first model explores the probability of four events: a firm staying the same size, expanding, contracting, or exiting. In the second stage, if the firm contracts or expands, we estimate the magnitude of the change. A suggested benefit is that researchers can better separate the likelihood of an event from its magnitude, thereby opening new avenues for research. We provide an overview of our model analyzing an example data set involving longitudinal venture level data. We provide a new package for the statistical software R.

Management research has a foundation in bounded rationality, wherein individuals seek to make the best choice to satisfy preferences within limits posed by informational incompleteness. This work addresses how the notion of rationality that models Western, male centric business concerns is not universal. Gender has been left out of the assumptions of boundedly rational models and the use of these models often advantage men at the expense of women. The work in this paper explores the absence of gender in the assumptions of bounded rationality and how this theory is applied in emerging contexts. The paper explores the structural obstacles based on bounded rationality that are imposed on women's businesses and their decision-making and how these obstacles constrain the potential of female entrepreneurs. The paper examines these issues through 220 interviews with stakeholders in the Kumasi Central Market social system in Kumasi, Ghana. The evidence shows that when considering business registration, what is most salient to entrepreneurs is the prevailing cultural expectations for men and women, despite female economic and social prowess as entrepreneurs that predated this business registration laws by centuries. This tension between expectations for female entrepreneurial competency and the simultaneous marginalization of female entrepreneurs using frameworks based on bounded rationality is explored.", July 2022,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

In this article, we seek to contribute to theory on market co-creation through effectuation. To achieve this goal, we examine the different kinds of reasoning behind stakeholder commitments in effectuation processes. Although effectual and causal logics sufficiently account for decision-making in instrumental rationality, scholars have paid little attention to value rationality, and how it might influence stakeholder commitments and behavior. Different commitments may follow different rationales, ranging from instrumentally rational commitments based on causal or effectual logics, to value rational commitments based on state-belief or change-belief. The typology of these four commitment reasoning types provides a framework for analyzing stakeholder behavior based on different perceptions of the commitment decision space. Our typology shows that commitments based on value rationality may be qualitatively different from those driven by instrumental rationality and that value rationality may enable commitments under conditions that preclude instrumentally rational actions. Furthermore, different commitments influence market co-creation processes in different ways. In this article, we examine how different commitments affect (1) conflict and effectual churn and (2) the relative 
path dependence
, or shapability, of the market co-creation space. Based on this typology, we propose avenues for future research on co-creation in effectuation processes, with a special focus on stakeholders.", July 2022,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

In contrast, flourishing women entrepreneurs, benefitting from prior work experience and family support, tended to set concrete goals for their entrepreneurial endeavors and had realistic expectations.

Our results suggest that decision content influences entrepreneurs' mental representations of decision structure.

Entrepreneurs and investors sometimes battle for control of new ventures when their relationships deteriorate, a phenomenon that we describe as entrepreneur-investor rivalry.

To address the disconnect between theory and practice, we develop an initial theory of entrepreneur-investor rivalry from the in-depth, qualitative analysis of a battle to control a renowned craft distillery. Our theory elaborates why entrepreneur-investor rivalry can occur, how it can unfold, and how it can conclude, attending to contextual factors and interaction dynamics that shape the outcomes of three sequential stages and the overall rivalry process. In conceptualizing the features of entrepreneur-investor rivalry, we improve extant theory's capacity to explain such rivalry, provide practical prescriptions to mitigate or avoid it, and till fertile ground on which to invigorate its study.

In their pursuit of “optimal distinctiveness,” firms need to simultaneously adhere to norms and stand out from the competition. Using longitudinal data from Amazon Launchpad, an online B2C marketplace for entrepreneurial products, we offer a multi-level perspective on optimal distinctiveness from a consumer goods market in which firms are active across different and heterogeneous product categories. Arguing along categorization, organizational identity, and the fit with audiences' 
theory of value
, we challenge the assumption that firm-level distinctiveness, i.e., the distinctiveness of a firm's organizational identity and category claims, delivers equal benefits to all products it offers and showcase the decisive role of product category context. In product categories that share less overlap with other categories and thus occupy a more distinct position in the classification system, products offered by firms with high firm-level distinctiveness benefit, whereas in product categories that share frequent relations to other categories and thus occupy a non-distinct position, products do not benefit at all. This offers researchers and managers alike a new and more nuanced perspective on firm-level distinctiveness: It is not invariably efficient in addressing audiences once the “optimal” level is found, but requires careful consideration of both the firm-level appeal and the product category in which a firm seeks to operate. Firm-level distinctiveness provides firms with the means to increase the differentiation of their own products, yet this effect is most meaningful in product categories with an increasingly distinct position.", July 2022,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

The growing schism between entrepreneurial action theory (EAT) on the one hand, and empirics and practice on the other hand, represents a consequential and exciting opportunity for the field to revisit its core assumptions regarding rationality, particularly the presence, role, and function of rational intentionality. In this study, we undertake a review and exploratory investigation of the assertion that without reasoned intentionality there is no entrepreneurship. Our work generates three important insights that contribute to rethinking key facets of the most prominent and influential EATs: alternative, non-rational pathways to business venturing exist with a non-ignorable prevalence; a proclivity towards reasoned intentionality is not invariably prescriptive; and, less-reasoned, less-deliberative tendencies do not constitute an entrepreneurial death sentence. Rather, entrepreneurs (including highly successful ones) embody a shifting blend of rational and non-rational proclivities, motivations, decisions, and actions.", May 2022,"rationality, non-rationality, impulse-driven logics, non-deliberative pathways, Entrepreneurial Action, entrepreneurial action theory, neurodiversity, ADHD, hypomania, impulsivity, mental health, entrepreneurship",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

We further theorize trait resilience as a self-regulation capacity that buffers this impairment process. We test the model in a study based on daily surveys over 10 workdays from 77 entrepreneurs.

Entrepreneurship scholars have devoted increasing attention to formalization (i.e., a firm's transition from informality to compliance with formal institutions). However, little is known about the actual

To understand how firms transition to full formality and manage the related institutional challenges in such contexts, we conduct a longitudinal, inductive 
case study

Necessity entrepreneurship can serve as a pathway out of poverty for low-income individuals, with microfinance often providing important financial support. Yet the relational lending strategies common among microfinance institutions may influence loan officer turnover and, in turn, compromise entrepreneurs' access to credit. While there is some reason to suspect that relational lending with poor entrepreneurs will increase retention, we propose that serving the poor may make loan officers more likely to 
quit
: loan officers in commercial microfinance institutions are unlikely to have strong commitments to 
poverty alleviation
 and may be taxed by the challenging fieldwork associated with lending in poor areas. Qualitative and quantitative data from a microfinance bank in Latin America support our expectations, showing that exit becomes more likely when loan officers' work involves more poor clients and that the effect is strongest when such work demands intensive fieldwork in low-income areas. Supplementary analyses of trends across the global microfinance 
industry
 demonstrate that poor clients have a stronger impact on exit in for-profits than non-profits, suggesting that prosocial motives among non-profit employees may have a buffering effect.

Investors in early-stage companies want to detect and select high-potential opportunities to maximize their long-term returns. However, in uncertain and risky early-stage investment contexts, company information is often opaque, and decision-making timeframes are compressed. Although there is an abundance of prior work on how investors make structured decisions based on their experience and expertise, there is a very limited understanding of how 
time-based factors
 can sway investment decisions. The circadian process is the 24-hour sequence that serves as an individual's internal timer influencing not only sleep cycles, but also attention and performance on a wide range of cognitive tasks. Understanding how the circadian process impacts early-stage investment holds implications for optimal investment decisions. We build on 
social cognitive theory
 and propose that investor-level factors (i.e., chronotypes) and environmental factors (time of the day) interact to influence the amount of information investors search for, and consequently, their investment decisions. We hypothesize and find that investors are influenced by the time of day they make early-stage investment decisions.

In order to succeed, technology ventures need to find a profitable market application for their technology.

Building on insights from organizational search literature, this study follows five university spin-offs trying to commercialize early-stage technologies. We find that ventures are cognitively constrained in proactively identifying and approaching external market actors. Interestingly, the better performing ventures in our sample engage in a previously undocumented market search process we label Technology Broadcasting. They communicate their technological competencies to a broad range of market actors and react to these actors' assessment and spontaneous expressions of interest, thereby overcoming their own cognitive constraints. Resource constraints require filtering these expressions of interest through Systematic Validation with additional market players.

There is growing interest in understanding the role of stakeholders—including financiers, employees, customers, suppliers, and communities—in the process of new venture emergence.

To do so, we seek to explain why, how, and when, through 
social action
, stakeholder identification and enrollment may (or may not) occur as an entrepreneur goes from an imagined opportunity to a new venture with enrolled stakeholders. To this end, we develop a model that conceptualizes stakeholder identification and enrollment as iterative, recursive, and constitutive social processes involving action in: refining and justifying to result in commonality with other actors; probing and positioning to result in mutuality with specific stakeholders identified; and enrolling and engaging to result in reciprocity with identified stakeholders. We argue that these social processes constitute the means through which opportunities are formed, specific stakeholders are identified, and stakes in new ventures are created and maintained, respectively.

 while offering intermediaries an alternative to critics' reviews when deciding whether to invest in creative products. Using data from the Chinese online self-publishing industry, we examine whether and how intermediaries use popular acclaim when deciding to invest in self-published books. We then flip the script and examine whether cultural entrepreneurs generate intermediary investment through popular acclaim and to what extent they do so through a digital 
serialization
 strategy. We find that, by encouraging both popular acclaim and intermediary investment, digital 
serialization
 emancipates cultural entrepreneurs from the indirect and uncertain reciprocity historically described by cultural 
entrepreneurship theory
. Instead, digital serialization allows cultural entrepreneurs to generate consumer attention directly through economic entrepreneurship and to alter the power and roles of intermediaries and entrepreneurs in the cultural production process.", November 2021,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

positivism
, which supposes no difference between the sciences, has been the tradition whence the economic rationality construct (
homo economicus
 and its modern variants) has derived, a longstanding interpretivist tradition holds that social science is innately distinct from, and should be studied differently than, the natural sciences. From this interpretivist vantage, we assess and critique the positivist conception of rationality and put forth a subjectivist account of rationality as a process in its stead. Rationality here emerges as an intentional process of betterment over time. Because entrepreneurship is definitionally such a process, we explore the implications of this process rationality for

Following the cognitive and behavioral approach, this study compares the trust behaviors of entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs in a dynamic environment.

Adopting established paradigms from behavioral 
game theory

When do entrepreneurs in emerging markets seek out help from organizational sponsors? Problemistic search theory suggests that entrepreneurs will seek out sponsors in moments of venture distress. However, this theory was developed in the context of large organizations; it is not clear how it might apply to entrepreneurs in resource-constrained contexts. We use three inductive studies conducted in favelas in Brazil to examine when entrepreneurs seek help. Consistent with problemistic search theory, we find evidence that entrepreneurs seek out help from organizational sponsors in moments of venture distress. We also explore what types of entrepreneurs are most likely to seek help in a situation of venture distress and find that entrepreneurs who are more socially embedded and have more social obligations are more likely to take up sponsorship services, leading to important heterogeneity in our results on take-up. We find that women, more mature ventures, and middle-aged entrepreneurs are all more likely to engage in problemistic search. We contribute to a more contextualized theory of problemistic search for small entrepreneurs in emerging markets. We also provide important theoretical and practical insights about the demand-side of organizational sponsorship.", November 2021,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Two perspectives stand out in examining international variations in innovative new venture creation: institutions and national culture. However, systematic insights into the interconnections between institutional and cultural perspectives and their effects on entrepreneurship are severely lacking. In order to fill this gap, the current research integrates two prominent yet under-explored institutional and cultural factors: linguistic future-time reference (FTR) as an institutional factor and long-term orientation as a cultural factor, and considers how they are linked through the time perspective reflected in risk and uncertainty perception. Drawing upon linguistic relativity theory and cultural theory, we propose that institutions with strong FTR languages and cultures with short-term orientation are more likely to foster innovative new venture creation. We utilized merged, multi-level, and multi-source data of 34,673 entrepreneurs from 42 countries to test our hypotheses. We also conducted a series of scenario-based, intra-group experiments with bilingual entrepreneurs to further confirm that strong-FTR has a positive relationship with innovative new venture creation.

Entrepreneurial resourcefulness is a concept that resonates with practitioners and scholars alike from a diverse set of theoretical and empirical backgrounds. Despite the prevalence and promise of this concept, the literature on entrepreneurial resourcefulness is fragmented and lacks cohesion in how it is labeled, conceptualized, measured, and deployed. In many cases, it appears that bringing resources to bear for entrepreneurial purposes is taken for granted, which limits theoretical development of if and how ventures emerge and grow.

In addition, we introduce the six articles that comprise the Special Issue on entrepreneurial resourcefulness, discuss their contributions, and explore how they relate to our overall perspective on resources and resourcefulness.

The emergence of large-scale digital platforms such as Facebook, Google Play and Apple App Store around 2008 has created opportunities for independent entrepreneurs to offer their self-developed software applications (“apps”) to large groups of platform users. The development and release of tens of thousands of apps by thousands of independent developers has created dynamic

However, entrepreneurs have only a few months during which they can benefit from what they learned from a prior app project.

Following legitimacy loss, we highlight how actors prioritize and sequence distinctiveness claims over legitimacy claims, which we refer to as distinctive legitimacy. We also identify a key mechanism of selective generalization, where identity claims are made to direct audience attention toward some (and not other) attributes of the organization and category to acquire resources.

Theory suggests that an earlier age at international entry results in improved growth but also decreased survival chances. Empirical studies tell a different story, providing mixed and equivocal results that challenge the tenets of extant theory. To begin to bridge the gap between theory and results, we develop theoretical explanations for curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationships between age at entry and both firm growth and firm survival as well as the moderating impact of resource-providing initial public offering (IPO) on the resource-intensive

We add richness and depth to investor decision-making research by exploring the influence of entrepreneurs' use of ingratiation rhetoric in their investor pitch presentations on investor funding decisions. Drawing on ingratiation theory, we model the effects of flattery, self-deprecation, opinion conformity, and self-promotion as distinct forms of ingratiation rhetoric. We do so independently and in tandem, conceptualizing the confluence of ingratiation forms as driving an overall aggregate effect on the amount of funding allocated by investors. We then theorize that entrepreneur charisma and entrepreneur performance are moderators of the aggregate effect. We test our model in the angel investment context with data from 789 entrepreneur pitch presentations to 27 investors on the

This study advances understanding of interpersonal feedback seeking as a relational micro-foundational process whereby social entrepreneurs proactively involve others in venturing and engage in sensemaking when this fails. Our inductive analysis of 82 interviews with 36 social entrepreneurs reveals the agency in and the plurality and precariousness of feedback seeking by identifying three distinct feedback-seeking trajectories. Feedback seeking is an identity-driven process whereby how and why social entrepreneurs seek feedback depends on their psychological closeness to the targeted social issue. Our study elucidates the relationship between identity and feedback processes and uncovers psychological distance from the social issue as a new construct in social venturing.", July 2021,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Interest in applying the idea of co-creation to entrepreneurship is emerging through research on opportunity creation and entrepreneur heuristics. We place co-creation in the conceptual center of the entrepreneurship research discussion. Doing so requires relaxing the view of a central entrepreneur and adopting a view of stakeholders as peers in the venture, providing resources and deriving benefit. We formalize this insightinto a central proposition and derive implications of it for major themes ofentrepreneurship research, entrepreneurial outcomes, and three challenges unique to entrepreneurship. The sum of our work suggests moving the discussion in entrepreneurship research from the unit of analysis of the individual entrepreneur, venture, or opportunity to entrepreneurship as a collaborative process undertaken by aconstellation of stakeholders that come together to co-create novelty in the environment.", July 2021,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

We examine how entrepreneurs rework the temporal commitments implicated in their venture ideas when they persevere or pivot upon confronting unexpected events. To gain a deeper understanding of how entrepreneurs recalibrate temporal positioning, length, and ordering of actions and milestones, we systematically analyzed 22 episodes across five ventures when entrepreneurs had to decide whether to persevere or to pivot. To persevere, entrepreneurs positioned their actions as a continuation of the past, while increasing the temporal length and complexity of temporal ordering, thereby avoiding disruptive changes to their relational commitments. In contrast, entrepreneurs repositioned their actions on a revised timeline in order to pivot. We conclude the paper by discussing the implications of our findings for theory on

Conceptualizing opportunity evaluation as a collective process, we develop an agent-based model to investigate how the social cognitive mechanisms of team formation affect the ability of

We find that opportunity evaluation decisions depend on the cognitive status of the lead entrepreneurs who found the team and the team formation strategy they use, i.e., whether they select team members based on interpersonal similarity (i.e., cognitive homophily) or complementary knowledge (i.e., cognitive heterophily). Moreover, we show that learning moderates the effects of team formation on opportunity evaluation.

Integrating the attention-based view and entrepreneurial alertness perspective, we develop our theoretical framework to test the influence of CEO attention and alertness on rate of new product introduction (NPI). We propose that a firm's rate of NPI is predicted independently and jointly by attention and alertness, two different yet complementary cognitive characteristics of the CEO. Using a sample of 271 US-based small and medium size

We also find that CEO alertness has positive impact on the rate of NPI; however, high alertness hurts the rate of NPI. Such theoretical elaboration and empirical illustrations contribute to a better understanding of the 
microfoundations

We argue that existing measures of entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) are underspecified in the context of tight-knit communities, where personal reputation plays a major role. We propose a new place-based ESE dimension that measures assessment by individuals of their ability to elicit respect from their community. This integral ESE component points to the very meaning of entrepreneurship in highly relational contexts. Although our enhanced ESE measure incorporates some influences of place, other aspects, such as geographical context, continue to moderate the relationship between ESE and entrepreneurial aptitude. We conclude with a discussion of the relevance and utility of this enhanced measure.
Executive summary
Scholars have invested considerable energy in understanding the motivations and practices of high-growth entrepreneurs and urban ecosystems, where business interactions tend to be impersonal and transactional. Most entrepreneurial measures assess either individual characteristics or place-based characteristics. Rural areas or developing regions, where entrepreneurs may be the best hope for 
revitalization
 (Sarasvathy, 2008), operate according to cultural principles that are different from those of “high-performance” 
entrepreneurial ecosystems
, and they remain understudied. We argue that in such resource-constrained, tight-knit communities, some important factors in the creation of a venture will jointly depend on place and individual—measuring the fitness of individuals in their community. In such environments, the belief of individuals in their ability to gain a positive reputation within their local community to advance their new 
enterprise
 is among the decisive factors for the venture creation process. We develop a measure of such beliefs.
We enhance measures of entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) to account for the confidence of individuals in their ability to fit within their community. ESE is the belief of an individual about his or her ability to perform the various tasks and roles required of a venture creator, which has been shown to be the most robust predictor of 
entrepreneurial actions
 and success. Current measures of ESE are place-agnostic; they assess a person's self-efficacy relative to general business activities, such as marketing, innovation, and so forth. However, some features of place have integral effects on ESE beliefs and act as neither antecedents nor moderators. We argue that a perceived ability to navigate complex social networks within the relevant community is a core component of ESE. How people see themselves in relation to their local community—and how they believe others see them—is central to how they think about their entrepreneurial potential. We propose a new ESE dimension that evaluates the fit between an individual and a place by measuring the confidence of an individual in their ability to elicit respect from the community (ERC). We expected ERC to be most relevant in small, tight-knit, and indigenous communities defined by social hierarchies (e.g., rural), where reputable individuals are better positioned to employ resources embedded in that place to benefit their 
enterprise
.
We developed a new ESE dimension that quantifies ERC beliefs. In doing so, we followed the established protocol (Furr, 2011; Hinkin, 1995). We derived an initial pool of items from existing literature (Chen et al., 1998; De Noble et al., 1999; McGee et al., 2009), enhanced this pool based on 
semistructured interviews
 with 23 rural residents with a history of self-employment, finalized the item pool based on feedback from eight experts, administered a large-scale survey of 1481 Kentucky residents (established, nascent, and non-entrepreneurs; approximately half of whom were from rural areas), derived the scale structure using exploratory and 
confirmatory factor analyses
, and examined its reliability and validity. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the enhanced ESE scale converged to the same structure in both rural and urban subsamples, which indicates that ERC is a unique dimension of ESE in both settings.
Although our enhanced ESE measure incorporates some components of place, we show that other aspects, such urban or rural context, continue to moderate the relationship between ESE and entrepreneurial aptitudes. For instance, the urban/rural moderates ERC's impact on individual propensity toward business risk-taking (BRT). In urban areas, as expected, the relationship between ERC and BRT was positive and monotonic. In rural areas, however, the relationship had an inverse U-shape, which may reflect the problem of over-embedding: whereas those who are embedded in their communities may be more likely to pursue entrepreneurship, a high level of community 
embeddedness
 could discourage venture creation. Overall, our results suggest that some common measures of entrepreneurship may be underspecified for small-world, relational environments. Many of these environments have been left behind by uneven development and thus could benefit from a research-based understanding of how to foster 
entrepreneurial activity
 and innovation.", May 2021,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Founders of hybrid ventures encounter organizational tensions that can compel compromise in both their organizations' and their own personal values.

In a multi-case study analysis we examine why social entrepreneurs differ in their responses to organizational tensions, both at the firm- and individual-level, and how such differences relate to their venture identification. Specifically, our findings reveal that strategic decisions made in the context of values-based complexity are often accompanied by concerns regarding founder authenticity—that is, judgments about the alignment between founders' actions and the commitments or responsibilities associated with their identities as entrepreneurs. Yet, because founders differ in the basis from which they seek to maintain such alignment, these differences shape both hybridity management and subsequent venture identification. By unpacking such differences, our findings contribute new theory, bridging recent scholarship on founder authenticity with longstanding research on organizational identification and hybrid organizing.", March 2021,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

New venture ideation is critical to the entrepreneurial process. To generate creative ideas, some entrepreneurs turn to cannabis, proposing its benefits.

 unknowability. When properly used, uncertainty reflects the epistemological assessment that enterprising actors may only believe – not know – that new ventures can succeed. When incorrectly used, uncertainty is misrepresented as an obstacle that can be overcome by some and not others. Second, we explain how prevalent linguistic practices (“opportunity discovery”, “opportunity recognition”) lie at the root of epistemological tensions in opportunity theory. They act as a distorting mirror that trivializes the unknowability of the future and nourishes impressions of mental agencies allowing entrepreneurs to know the unknowable. Third, we urge a more nuanced understanding of the knowledge problems of entrepreneurship. On the one hand, we submit that opportunities are ineliminably unknowable. On the other hand, however, we argue that there exist knowable Opportunity-Ingredients (OIs) whose knowability varies across contexts. These analytical developments further contribute to the ongoing “opportunity wars”, strengthen the epistemological foundations of opportunity-actualization, improve construct clarity, and reveal new possibilities for research.", March 2021,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Results strongly indicate that those who survived greater hardship during the Famine are more likely to become entrepreneurs, especially when they were younger during the famine years. We also find that being younger at the time of migration increased the likelihood of becoming entrepreneurs in their new locale. Overall, this study casts light on why, how and when childhood adversity shapes the propensity for entrepreneurship.", January 2021,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Entrepreneurs often face the daunting task of predicting consumer demand before it exists—what consumers will want if and when the entrepreneur might make it available to them. Such alertness and judgment require an entrepreneur's vicarious imagination—the supposition of what a value experience would be like for another—such as empathy. Prevailing theories of empathy, however, are ill-suited for entrepreneurship theory as they are defined as and focused on an emotion-matching process. We propose that empathy be understood instead as a vicarious mental simulation of another's experience that, when accurate, produces similar emotions but also similar experiential knowledge. According to our ‘simulated empathy theory,’ empathy is a rational imagination process, intentional and knowledge-based. We connect this empathy process to contemporary entrepreneurship theory, namely opportunity recognition and evaluation processes. We also revise the concept of empathic accuracy accordingly, and derive therefrom some practical implications regarding how entrepreneurs can increase their empathic accuracy and, thereby, their chances of success.", January 2021,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

The

 that form around university-based technologies influence whether and how those technologies are commercialized. Past research has emphasized the roles of external actors, such as technology transfer officers or investors, in managing the evolution of academic startup teams. But less is known about how individual scientist-inventors form their initial teams. To explore that process, we conducted longitudinal interviews with nine scientist-inventors leading nascent startups at major U.S. universities. Our analyses revealed that these scientists were working with a more extensive set of commercially-relevant knowledge and network connections than past research has accounted for. In fact, the scientists had their own “lay theories” of academic entrepreneurship that encompassed team-specific ideas as well as broader ideas about how their technologies ought to be commercialized. We identified four “design principles” capturing key variations in what the scientists hoped to achieve through their teams:

Executive summary
The work population is aging, and entrepreneurship has become an attractive career option for both the young and the old. Age has often been included in empirical studies as a control variable to predict entrepreneurs' success, but with inconsistent empirical findings and inadequate attention to age's theoretical role, it is not clear whether older entrepreneurs are as successful as their younger counterparts.
The current study has two related components. First, we provided a much-needed review of the alternative theoretical perspectives on the effect of age on entrepreneurial success. These 12 perspectives focused on various age-related mechanisms, namely personal health, 
rigidity
, risk propensity, time's value, discrimination, 
human capital
, social capital, financial capital, emotion, life stages, family obligation, and gender stereotype. We found that explicit theoretical explanations are rare and fragmented for addressing entrepreneurs' age-success relationship. Most of the existing perspectives are simplistic, equivocal, and sometimes contradictory. Guided by the above review, we proposed several research questions about several contingency factors, such as the entrepreneur's life stage, gender, and tenure running the business, which would help us gain a more nuanced understanding of the age-success relationship.
Second, we empirically examined the research questions in an exploratory meta-analysis based on 102 independent samples. Indeed, we found more nuanced results than are typically apparent. The results show that age has a weak, positive linear relationship with overall entrepreneurial success (
ρ
̂
=0.02), but it does exhibit signs of a U-shaped relationship, with the relationship being negative among younger samples but positive among older samples. The positive effect size becomes more pronounced when more females are included in the sample, suggesting female entrepreneurs' chance of success is higher at later life stages. The effect size of age does not differ by entrepreneurs' tenure running the firm, thus ruling out the possibility that the age-success effect is primarily driven by tenure effect or selection bias.
We performed some robustness checks for the meta-analytic results. We found age's effect is not affected by the study's publication year, but the effect differs across the world. In terms of the type of success measures, we found age has a negative effect on growth, but a positive effect on subjective success, firm size, and financial success, and no effect on firm survival. Older entrepreneurs tend to have larger businesses, so older entrepreneurs are “punished” for having a larger denominator in the calculation of growth, putting them in an unfair position if growth is the sole measure of success.
We compared our results with previous meta-analyses on employees' age, and one clear distinction is that previous meta-analyses reported an inverted U-shaped relationship between employees' age and overall performance, while our study shows the opposite, U-shaped relationship between entrepreneurs' age and success. This difference is probably due to the fact that entrepreneurial careers involve different resource commitments, job requirements, and success criteria compared to traditional careers, making people at a specific age more likely to succeed in one career but not in the other.
Our study shows that researchers need to rethink the theoretical role of age, account for potentially simultaneous operation of theoretical mechanisms, and identify new research directions. We call for more studies to address the unique promises and challenges entrepreneurs in each life stage will face, and we provided some suggestions to increase the rigor of future studies. It is imperative to study the intra-individual aging effect through tracking a large cohort of entrepreneurs over decades with repeated measures of their cognitive intelligence, motivations, role identities, and success. Because male entrepreneurs outnumber female entrepreneurs, it is necessary to oversample female entrepreneurs or seek a matched sample, so that any gender-related differential effects can be demonstrated fully. Because many entrepreneurs work in teams, future studies can compare founding teams of the same age (e.g., college classmates) and teams of different ages, and investigate how members of each type of team can collaborate to maximize their chance of success.", January 2021,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

We focus on meaningfulness as an important eudaimonic process and subjective vitality as a eudaimonic well-being outcome that is central to entrepreneurs' proactivity.

autonomy
. In a multi-level study of 22,002 individuals and 16 European countries, meaningfulness at work mediates the relationship between self-employment and subjective vitality and explains this relationship better than work autonomy. We identify moderating effects of context: the societal legitimacy of entrepreneurship in a country affects the choice set of alternative career options that individuals can consider and thus shapes the experience of meaningfulness at work and work autonomy, and thereby indirectly subjective vitality.

Given myriad possible combinations of individual imaginativeness in newly forming teams, we ask whether team configurations might vary in composition and performance when seeking to generate and develop new venture ideas. To answer this question, we conduct a field survey of 51 new venture teams in six different startup competitions.

Young firms in business-to-business markets often experience a high level of dependence on a key customer, but what are the firm-level effects of such dependence on survival and growth? And what can entrepreneurs do to manage such dependence? Many of the mechanisms suggested by resource dependence studies (such as safeguarding investments, symmetrical dependence, or acquisitions) are not available for young firms with limited resources. In this article, we develop a knowledge-based framework to examine how young firms can utilize congenital, experiential, and interorganizational learning to manage the effects of dependence on firm survival and growth. We test our hypotheses in a sample of young technology-based firms in the UK. First, we find a significant negative effect of key customer dependence on firm survival. Further, we find that 
experiential knowledge
 (accumulated as the firm ages) mitigates this negative effect, indicating that dependence is particularly hazardous for the youngest firms. Surprisingly, contrary to our hypothesis, we find that, for surviving firms, dependence has a 
positive
 effect on customer portfolio growth, and that this effect is stronger for less experienced, i.e., younger, firms. The effect is also amplified by congenital learning from the top management team's 
industry
 experience. Finally, interorganizational learning (facilitated by the relationship quality of the key customer relationship) has a 
negative
 moderating effect on the dependence-growth relationship. This indicates an impeding effect on the young firm's ability to acquire other customers.

Entrepreneurs face the challenge of having to conform to gain legitimacy, while at the same time differentiating themselves to gain competitive advantage. We show how entrepreneurs can craft an entrepreneurial narrative to succeed in this task among the user audiences empowered to evaluate their products. Building on theories of categorization, optimal distinctiveness, and cultural entrepreneurship, we propose that entrepreneurs should utilize the narrative's semantic relations with cultural meanings of established products and categories. We measure these semantic relations using machine learning methods for natural language, applied to data on 2901 independent video game proposals compared to 11,651 established games. Our findings reveal that semantically anchoring a product's narrative in the cultural meaning of claimed categories can help to leverage the benefits of differentiation, especially when spanning multiple, atypical categories. When a product focuses on few categories, semantically enriching a narrative with unclaimed categories' cultural meaning makes them more favorable to additional, possibly fragmented audiences that would not have considered them otherwise. Our results point to a key theoretical role of cultural entrepreneurship in shaping audience evaluation of categorization and differentiation by entrepreneurial ventures. It provides guidelines for entrepreneurs for managing the trade-off between differentiation and adherence to established cultural norms.", November 2020,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Fear of failure is an important part of the experience of entrepreneurship. Yet past research has mainly investigated fear of failure in entrepreneurship among non entrepreneurs or nascent entrepreneurs and has done so by asking for reactions to hypothetical future failure. This approach to operationalizing the construct limits our capacity for understanding how entrepreneurs actually experience fear of failure while practicing entrepreneurship. In this paper, we conceptualize entrepreneurial fear of failure as a negative affective reaction based in cognitive appraisals of the potential for failure in the uncertain and ambiguous context of entrepreneurship. We use multiple samples to develop and validate a multidimensional, formative measure to assess entrepreneurial fear of failure as a state that is both cognitive and affective in nature. In addition to evidence of the 
psychometric
 properties of the new scale across multiple studies, we present a nomological network analysis with respect to measures of theoretically derived psychological outcomes and perceived behavioral tendencies of entrepreneurial fear of failure. We then discuss the theoretical, methodological, and empirical implications of this new measure of entrepreneurial fear of failure with an eye towards use of this scale in future research.", September 2020,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

The creation of commons—resources that are shared, accessible, and collectively owned and managed by communities—is increasingly being adopted by social entrepreneurs as a way of contributing to community development and putting value into economic activities. Yet, little research is evident related to the entrepreneurial processes involved in the creation and commercialization of these shared resources. Drawing on the Institutional Analysis and Development framework developed by Ostrom (2005), I explain how commons are entrepreneurially created. Based on a 
comparative study
 of five community banks in Brazil, I derive two ideological principles of collective entrepreneurship that help sustain commercialization of commons without 
commodification
, namely ‘self-organization’ and ‘right to access’. I elucidate how these principles are enacted across venture levels through downward and upward mechanisms of social control facilitated by entrepreneurs who enhance collective action. This article contributes to the 
entrepreneurship theory
 of commons by explaining how commons are entrepreneurially created and by adding the collective entrepreneurship principles and mechanisms that commons of different types need in order to achieve and sustain wealth-creation options without incurring the downsides of

An increasing number of entrepreneurial ventures are growing at exponential rates despite their founders' professed intentions

Through an inductive, phenomenon-based research approach, we explore how artisan entrepreneurs subscribe to a counter-institutional identity yet engage in a divergent set of behaviors. We discover that artisans' counter-institutional identity contains two sides—promoting the exclusion of ‘who we are not’ (oppositional identity) or providing support for ‘who we are’ (relational identity). We theorize that artisan entrepreneurs' differing views regarding their 
independence
 led to very different approaches to growth. When artisans either do not see forms of external control as impinging on their independence or sense that serving stakeholders is a means to perform relational identity work, they embrace growth. Thus, artisans may find that growth serves stakeholders, but funding growth brings about financial pressures, which may force the artisan down a path of growth.", September 2020,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Entrepreneurial effort triggers action towards business creation and constitutes the ultimate link between intention and action. Although occupations play a significant role in entrepreneurial entry, extant research has not thoroughly investigated primary occupational characteristics as specific antecedents of entrepreneurial effort. We contribute to this line of research by proposing and testing a model in which three occupational characteristics at the occupational level (managerial knowledge, self-accomplishment, and arduousness) are correlated with two cognitive factors at the individual level (effort-performance and instrumentality beliefs) that in turn affect behavior (entrepreneurial effort). We draw upon expectancy theory to motivate our model and combine data from the PSED and O*NET to test our hypotheses. We find compelling evidence that individuals facing arduous working conditions and lacking personal accomplishment in their salaried jobs will be more committed to their new business. In addition, we find that entrepreneurs coming from occupations involving high levels of managerial knowledge tend to put more effort into the new venture.", September 2020,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

After accumulating evidence of reliability and validity for a new measure of frugality contextualized for entrepreneurship research, the results support our self-regulatory theoretical framework.

Organizational sponsorship impacts new venture emergence and survival prospects by shaping the relationship between new ventures and their surrounding environment. While extant literature offers an explanation as to why heterogeneity in the effectiveness of sponsorship emerges based on the sponsor's characteristics, current theorizing largely overlooks how sponsorship interacts with local 
economic conditions
. This study introduces insights from 
urban economics
 to extend organizational sponsorship theory by showing how different types of 
agglomeration economies
 affect the effectiveness of organizational sponsorship. We test our hypotheses with a comprehensive database that includes over 46,000 sponsored and non-sponsored firms in the years 1997–2007. Our results reveal organizational sponsorship delays new venture exit when urbanization levels are low, localization is low, and both urbanization and localization are high.
Executive Summary.
Organizational sponsorship (OS) is an institutional arrangement whereby private or public entities provide assistance to new firm ventures. Since young firms face low survival chances at birth, it is assumed that any assistance such firms receive is to their advantage. However, very little research supports this assumption (
Clayton et al., 2018
; 
Dutt et al., 2016
). It is in this context that we examine the impact of OS in different regional environments. Specifically, we look at the interplay between business incubation, a ubiquitous form of OS, urbanization, the city-scale of the region in which the firm is founded, and localization, the presence of same-industry firms in the region, in determining new venture survival. By exploring this interaction, we identify how the efficacy of OS varies in differing environmental circumstances. Additionally, it provides a better understanding of the specific OS mechanisms that are most likely to promote new venture survival depending on regional characteristics.
For the purposes of our study, we combine insights from OS and agglomeration literatures. Specifically, we look at the interplay between the bridging, buffering and curating functions of OS with the externalities that arise from urbanization and localization. We consider the regional characteristics that provide new ventures with positive agglomeration externalities of input sharing, quick and quality matching with resource providers, and knowledge 
spillovers
. Similarly, we also consider regional characteristics that give rise to negative externalities of rising costs and congestion. Thus, we identify urbanization and localization scenarios in which new ventures are most in need of buffering from competition, in the form of financial aid and subsidies, and scenarios where new ventures need to be bridged or curated with non-monetary resources such as 
accountants
, lawyers, or industry-specific suppliers and investors. That is, we identify founding environments in which OS functions are most valuable.
We test our hypothesis on a population of US business incubators operating between 1997 and 2007. To study the impact of OS at different levels of urbanization and localization, we compare the probability of exit by incubated new ventures with that of a control group of non-incubated new ventures in the same county. We find that incubators are most effective in improving the survival of new ventures when both localization and urbanization in the founding environment are low or when both are high.
By linking OS literature with agglomeration literature our study identifies the conditions under which OS is most effective and finds that it is most effective when mitigating the lows of resource-deprived environments or the highs of a hyper-competitive landscape. We also extend the theoretical link between these two streams of literature by identifying the critical role of the OS function of curating in a highly localized and urbanized environment.
Our study sheds new light on why OS is often met with varying levels of success in promoting new venture survival. We see that specific regional characteristics determine the type of OS mechanisms that are most beneficial. Thus, for instance, simply mimicking successful incubators in one region may not lead to success for incubators in other regions. Furthermore, we see that OS is counterproductive in regions with low urbanization and high localization. Together, these findings suggest that policy-makers need to consider the specific constraints faced by entrepreneurs in different regions before they seek to promote entrepreneurship through OS. It also stresses the need for entrepreneurs to do 
due diligence
 prior to joining an incubator.", July 2020,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Empirical evidence is mounting that passion is an important part of entrepreneurship, contributing to behavior and outcomes for entrepreneurs, employees, and ventures. Yet knowledge of the performance implications of passion within new venture teams is sorely lacking. We examine how both the average level of entrepreneurial passion and the diversity of passion within new venture teams contributes to venture performance in both the short- and long-term. We test our model with multi-source, multi-wave data collected from 107 new venture teams participating in an accelerator program. Our findings indicate that average team passion is not significantly related to performance, but passion diversity, particularly intensity separation, is negatively related to performance. These findings have important implications for the literature on passion, new venture teams, and group affective diversity.
Executive summary
While existing studies have substantially improved our understanding of entrepreneurial passion, its sources, and its subsequent impact, insight into this topic remains limited in at least three ways. First, most new ventures are founded and led by teams rather than individuals, yet existing studies predominantly focus on entrepreneurial passion at the individual rather than team level. Second, while there is a prevailing assumption in existing literature that entrepreneurial passion leads to beneficial outcomes consistent with longstanding work in psychology, there is emerging evidence in entrepreneurship that passion may not always be functional and that it can even be dysfunctional. Despite this, we have limited understanding of what types of passion or when or for whom it is dysfunctional. And third, extant work on entrepreneurial passion for individuals and within teams has focused on behavioral or self-report measures of performance (e.g. Cardon and Kirk, 2015; Santos & Cardon, 2019) as well as venture survival, rather than objective team or firm performance in the short- and long-term.
In this paper, we study the influence of team passion on new venture team performance. We draw on theory concerning entrepreneurial passion within venture teams (Cardon et al., 2017) that suggests that different aspects of entrepreneurial passion within teams shape team dynamics and venture outcomes. While generally, theories of passion suggest that entrepreneurial passion is positively related to team outcomes due to the positive emotions it brings about, we find that in teams, the relationships are more complex. While the average level of passion among team members is positively related to team performance when considered alone, this effect is not significant when passion diversity is also considered. Diversity of passion among individual team members has a negative relationship with team performance, including diversity in the level of passion team members experience (intensity separation), as well as diversity in the object of their passion (focus variety). These negatively affect team dynamics due to conflicting emotions and identities among team members associated with passion diversity. We examine these relationships on specific team performance outcomes including evaluation of the business idea in the short-term and venture performance five years after their participation in an accelerator.
The sample used in this study includes 107 
entrepreneurial teams
 that were part of an accelerator program in the Netherlands. Teams were evaluated on the quality of their business ideas at the end of the accelerator program and the amount of investment the team had received five years later. Our results provide no support for positive effects of average team passion on the quality of the business ideas and confirm the negative effects of passion intensity separation on the quality of the business idea and the negative effects of passion focus variety on later venture performance.
This paper makes several contributions. First, we expand the literature on passion in entrepreneurship, specifically adding to our understanding of passion within new venture teams. More specifically, we contribute to the growing body of evidence concerning potential dysfunctions of passion by uncovering a dysfunctional property of team passion diversity that uniquely manifests itself at the team level of analysis. We contribute to the literature on new venture teams by examining team composition in the form of passion diversity, and its relationship with team performance. Finally, our study extends work on the effects of entrepreneurial passion by looking at objective team performance outcomes in both the short- and long-term.
For entrepreneurs, our findings confirm the importance of affect and identity for new venture teams, and specifically our findings indicate that there is a dark side to team passion. While passion is generally positioned as a positive phenomenon, we highlight the negative outcomes that passion can have in the team context. Diversity in the amount of passion team members experience can diminish the quality of the business ideas the team is able to generate in the short-term, while diversity in the focus of team members' passion can diminish the firm's long-term performance. For investors and accelerator communities this research validates the importance of considering entrepreneurial team composition and specifically entrepreneurial passion levels and domains when investing in teams or when supporting venture building.", July 2020,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Refugee-entrepreneurs' resilience in the face of substantial and persistent adversity,"Dean A.=Shepherd: Dshepherd@indiana.edu, Fouad Philippe=Saade: philippe.saade@hanken.fi, Joakim=Wincent: joakim.wincent@hanken.fi","Executive summary
People face adverse events in a variety of forms. Some individuals are resilient to adverse events in that they are able to maintain positive functioning while others experience considerable disruption. In explaining heterogeneity in resilience, research has emphasized people's resource endowments and pre-adversity organizing 
prior
 to the adverse events as well as people's cognitive and behavioral responses to such events. Therefore, for most resilience studies, adversity is an event. Although it is critically important to understand resilience to these short- to medium-term adverse events, there is a need to understand resilience over an extended period. In this regard, we focus on Palestine refugees who were born in refugee camps and as adults have known nothing other than being a refugee.
When it comes to substantial and persistent adversity, 
entrepreneurial action
 likely plays a central role in resilience to such adversity. To explore these relationships, we conducted an extensive data-collection effort over 15 months on refugee entrepreneurs (in refugee camps and not in camps), including 110 interviews. We find the importance of direct, indirect, and recursive relationships among actions (i.e., 
entrepreneurial action
 and integration activities), multiple identities, and resilience outcomes under conditions of substantial and persistent adversity. Furthermore, we find important differences between refugee entrepreneurs who live in refugee camps and those who live outside these camps—differences in affiliation, language use, and social capital development—which enable those refugee entrepreneurs living outside the refugee camps to achieve resilience outcomes not accessible to those living inside the camps.
Overall, this study makes a number of contributions to the entrepreneurship literature. First, research has investigated resilience in terms of resources, endowments, and capabilities before an adverse event. The implicit assumptions in this research are that capabilities matter and that adversity has a beginning and subsides over time. In this study, we focus on resilience outcomes in the context of refugees facing substantial adversity over a substantial period and extend the capability argument of resilience in the following ways: (1) the “social” capability for resilience, not as an endowment but created through activities that build a social basis for resilience outcomes, (2) 
social integration
 activities are initiated and facilitated by engaging in entrepreneurial action with non-similar others, and (3) resilience outcomes help individuals both engage in integration activities and build a social capability of resilience. Therefore, in the context of substantial and persistent adversity, refugee entrepreneurs need to act in order to build (rather than simply deploy) their social capability for resilience outcomes.
Second, resilience has been explored as either a process 
or
 as an outcome. In this study, we find that resilience outcomes are both a consequence and an antecedent of entrepreneurial action—a mutually dependent relationship. Specifically, we find the dimensions of resilience outcomes to include proactive problem solving, moral gains as a broader purpose in life, self-reliance, realistic optimism, and multiple sources of belonging. What is interesting is that these outcomes are also important inputs to entrepreneurial action and the resilience process.
Finally, there has been an important stream of research on the role of identity in recovery from adversity. We find that refugee entrepreneurs' actions provide a basis for changing the mix of their multiple identities. Therefore, we enrich the entrepreneurship identity literature through the insight that in this persistently adverse context, the relationship between entrepreneurial action and identity is not one way and static but bidirectional and dynamic. Furthermore, over and above refugee entrepreneurs' prosocial motivation of compassion, we find a new form of prosocial motivation for entrepreneurial action—the motivation to promote solidarity: “You are not alone; we are in this together as part of a broader purpose in life.”", July 2020,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

In this paper we use a new methodology aimed at identifying only the venture capitalists (VC) treatment effect: we compare a representative sample of firms financed by private VC in the period 2004–2014 with a sample of firms rejected by VC at the very late-stages of the screening process. These firms narrowly lost the contest and are hence very similar, 
before VC financing
, to the VC backed firms; self-selection is specifically taken into account. In line with previous results, Italian startups financed by VC reach a larger size and become more innovative than other startups. On the contrary, sales growth is similar and profitability is worse than firms in the control group. VC-backed companies experience larger rise in labor costs, while the commercialization of their innovative projects takes longer: this explains their worse profitability and the deterioration in their credit score. Both effects tend to disappear after four years from VC financing, when sales increase for VC-backed firms at the same pace as for the control group. Unlike other studies, no differences are detected for the survivorship rates of VC-backed firms in Italy. We also provide new evidence on the impact of VC on firms’ financial structures: VC-backed firms show a much larger increase in equity; this rise is however only half the increase in total assets that is hence not only explained by the injection of VC equity. Another result in this direction is that the effects on firms’ size and innovation hold when we restrict the control group to firms that also increase their equity from investors different from VC; this suggests that VC effects on size and innovation might also be linked to their managerial expertise and network connections.

This paper positions effectuation as a network-driving and network dependent phenomenon and suggests that understanding networks and network processes is essential to understanding the dynamics of effectuation. We argue that the implementation of effectuation is influenced by the nodal, relational, and structural characteristics of pre-existing and emerging networks, and by the processes through which these networks come about. We use these arguments to develop a multi-level, multi-theoretical reconceptualization of effectuation that provides for distributed agency and collective cognition of network members. We allow for the simultaneous and interactional use of effectual and causal logics, as well as the co-construction of knowledge, identity, and social capital within and across network levels. Our model also addresses changing uncertainty as opportunities develop, nuances of effectual interactions, and evolving market dynamics. Our propositions and reflections offer directions for further studies at the intersection of network and effectuation research.
Executive summary
There is little doubt that effectuation is reshaping how we think about entrepreneurial cognition and behavior. A core argument is that under conditions of uncertainty, entrepreneurs can co-create opportunities by collaborating with other willful agents. This moves us away from classical views of entrepreneurship and positions effectuation as a network-driving and network-dependent phenomenon. Yet, recent debate highlights that effectuation research has paid insufficient attention to the network of external parties involved. As a result, although the extant model of effectuation recognizes the importance of networks, our understanding of the relationship between effectual logic and entrepreneurial networks is far from complete.
Several theoretically important and practically relevant questions arise from this knowledge gap. For example if we think about network development, how are potential stakeholders brought to mind and persuaded to commit if end-points and stakeholder preferences are both unknowable? What are the characteristics (i.e. structure, content and governance) of the networks that emerge through these commitments? Reciprocally, how do the characteristics of the emerging network influence effectual processes and outcomes?
In this paper, we begin to address this line of questioning by considering effectuation not only at the level of the individual but also through lenses reflective of the three levels of analysis commonly adopted in network research: i) dyadic relationships, ii) the entrepreneurial network, and iii) the market more generally. While we attend to pre-existing networks (the constitution of which is likely to affect the probability of adopting effectual logic), our focus is on linking the individual and emerging networks across these levels.
At the level of the individual, we break from prior effectuation research and ascribe new and influential roles to entrepreneurial ideas and instrumental 
mindsets
 in focusing an entrepreneur's attention on particular relationships (i.e. the cognitive activation of a cohesive network involving interested and persuadable individuals). At the level of the dyad, we suggest the very nature of interactions between actors can influence individual choice of logic. We specify that stakeholders will expect signs of process legitimacy (e.g. cognitive flexibility on the part of the entrepreneur) before making effectual commitments. We also move away from assumptions about 
altruistic behavior
 to suggest that power and influence will accrue to stakeholders whose resources are at risk and/or perceived by others to resolve uncertainty. At the level of the entrepreneurial network, we link effectuation to a 
brokerage
 orientation (
tertius iungens)
 that enhances inclusiveness surrounding means and collective cognition. Moreover, we move beyond the narrow view of facilitating and constraining factors portrayed in the effectuation literature to argue that (e.g.) i) with respect to network content, resource specificity will shape possible futures; ii) with respect to governance, trust, supported by social mechanisms will predominate; and, iii) with respect to structure, specific network characteristics will be more supportive of certain aspects of effectuation than others (e.g. cohesive networks are more supportive of collaboration, but may limit the flexibility needed to embrace contingencies). At the market level, we posit that on the one hand, institutions will shape effectual processes. On the other hand, effectual processes are more likely than causal processes to create new institutions and/or supplant existing institutions.
Overall, our study contributes to the understanding of both effectuation and networks by offering a multi-level, multi-theoretical re-conceptualization of the dynamics of effectuation. Our arguments should spur research in at least three interdependent areas: i) uncertainty and individual cognition; ii) network processes surrounding interactions and commitments; and iii) the contingent effects of network characteristics on effectuation. For practitioners, our insights should help shape thoughts about i) who to interact with in the face of uncertainty; ii) what stories to tell and how to deal with image management; iii) what to expect during negotiations; iv) how to broker relationships to enhance the ‘co’ in ‘co-creation’; and moreover, v) what network characteristics might facilitate or constrain their efforts.", March 2020,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Building on the insights from 
observational learning
 and other social influence research, this study challenges the existing literature that proposes a linear relationship between prior funding and subsequent contributions in the crowdfunding setting. Instead, we propose a U-shaped relationship, illustrating a 
negative relationship
 between prior funding and subsequent contributions when funding amounts are small and this relationship becomes positive when prior funding amounts are large. Consistent with the rational herding perspective, we assume that individuals do not mindlessly mimic one others' behaviors, but incorporate quality signals into their decision-making. Signals indicating a high quality project such as video quality, as well as the preparedness and passion of the entrepreneur enhance this U-shaped relationship whereas indicators of situational urgency weaken this relationship. Based on a sample of 11,019 daily observations of 333 Kickstarter projects, we find general support for our hypotheses. Our post hoc experiment further supports the mechanisms underlying the U-shaped relationship. This paper extends our understanding of the relationship between past actions and subsequent behavior, and contributes to the literatures of 
observational learning
, crowdfunding, and visual information.
Executive summary
We challenge the extant literature that has proposed, but inconsistently documented, a positive effect of prior funding on subsequent crowdfunding contributions. We argue that such inconsistency is due to the lack of integration of insights from other social influence research, such as 
observational learning
, threshold models, and 
bystander effects
. This research has been limited when postulating that crowdfunding backers simply imitate others' actions in order to mitigate uncertainty producing a linear effect, yet such an effect depends on the intensity of others' actions and may be curvilinear. This research overlooks the fact that backers do not merely passively imitate others' behaviors, but incorporate quality signals sent by entrepreneurs to make such decisions. Thus, it is important to account for potential moderators that may influence the complex relationship between prior funding and subsequent contributions.
Based on 
observational learning
 research and related models, accrued prior funding may be perceived differently by potential backers: individuals may view accrued funding as a sign of a decreased funding need on the part of a campaign's creators, because others are already backing the campaign or, alternatively, they may see it as a cue of high 
product quality
. These conflicting effects may lead to a U-shaped relationship between prior funding and subsequent contributions at a collective level. At low funding levels, prior funding may be negatively associated with subsequent contributions because such levels indicate there is already support, but that the campaign may not be of high quality. At medium levels, prior funding may have no effect on contributions, aside from halfhearted interest of other backers. At high levels, prior funding may be positively related to subsequent contributions as this sends a robust cue of project quality and convinces prospective donors to contribute. Further, we derive a U-shaped relationship which may be moderated by visual media-based quality signals and situational urgency.
To test these hypotheses, we conducted two studies. One was a 
field study
 of 333 Kickstarter projects, with 11,019 daily observations of crowdfunding activities from mid-February 2013 through mid-April 2013. We used the Kicktraq website to track Kickstarter projects and recruited 390 participants via 
Amazon
 
Mechanical Turk
 (MTurk) to evaluate the video pitches on Kickstarter. Our results suggest a 
negative relationship
 between prior funding and subsequent contributions when funding amounts are small. This relationship becomes positive when prior funding amounts are large. Thus, we find a U-shaped relationship between prior funding and subsequent contributions, with an 
inflection point
 when prior funding amounts reach between 72% and 80% of the funding goal. This is strengthened in the presence of visual media-based quality signals, such as video quality, as well as the preparedness and passion of the entrepreneur. However, indicators of situational urgency may weaken this U-shaped relationship.
We followed up with a post hoc experiment to document the two mechanisms by which prior funding influence subsequent contributions. We found that increases in the prior funding amount increased perceived 
product quality
 but decreased perceived urgency. These perceptions were found to jointly influence participants' proposed pledged amounts, supporting an explanation of a complex relationship between prior funding and subsequent contributions.
This study is among the first to offer a more complete picture of the relationship between past actions and subsequent behavior under market and institutional constraints (i.e., when market actors observe the censored behaviors of other actors on crowdfunding platforms) and contributes to the literatures of 
observational learning

The popular business press and academic articles have promoted the virtues of failure, particularly in the pursuit of innovation. Surprisingly, there has been very little systematic empirical study to support this belief. This article distinguishes two organizational approaches to failure: normalizing it (tolerating failure as a necessary part of the innovation process) and analyzing it (purposeful attempts to convert failure experiences into knowledge). A

 of 106 U.S. manufacturing firms indeed finds that mere tolerance for failure has no effect on firm product innovativeness. In contrast, firms that make deliberate efforts to analyze past failures introduce more innovative new products. Further, this effect is contingent on a climate of constructive conflict within the firm. Hence, to foster firm innovativeness, organization members need to extract lessons from failure, and such analysis must take place in a climate of constructive conflict that enables open and honest discussion.", January 2020,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

However, why some problems gain traction as being worthy of time and effort in solving, has garnered little attention. We argue that particular problems are more or less salient triggers of action by prospective social entrepreneurs based on the distribution of such problems in the local social environment, rather than aggregate levels of need. Yet, even problems widely experienced as shared, salient, and generally worthy of action might lack the emergence of solutions in fragmented communities, such as those with high levels of residential segregation by race and income. We study this in the context of founding of advocacy and support organizations in the domain of healthcare, and find support for our predictions. We also conducted additional tests to better characterize the findings and test robustness to alternative sources of influence, such as the local pool of potential social entrepreneurs, the role of local ecology, and geographic spillovers from neighboring areas.", November 2019,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Domestic violence is the most prevalent form of gender-based violence that threatens the 
wellbeing
 and dignity of women. In this paper, we examine whether and how exposure to physical or sexual assault by male partners influences women's decision to initiate a new business when they have access to financing. We collected primary data from rural Bangladesh in collaboration with a microfinance institution that provided small collateral-free loans to a group of married women. We conducted a baseline survey before loan disbursement and then conducted a follow-up survey 12 to 15 months later to collect information on loan usage. We find that women who experienced physical or sexual violence by their husband before receiving a loan are less likely to initiate a new business with their loan than those who did not experience such violence. Exposure to domestic violence obstructs the initiation of new businesses through reduced entrepreneurial self-efficacy and increased fear of business failure. The adverse impact of domestic violence is more detrimental for women who recently experienced another potentially traumatic event—an environmental disaster—than for those without such an experience.", November 2019,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Strategic posture and investment time horizon influence corporations' choice of acceleration path and their identification of potential ventures for acceleration.

Entrepreneurship research on prosocial motivation has outlined its positive impact on well-being, but still little is known about its power, which may have deleterious personal consequences under certain conditions. In this study, we ask whether prosocial motivation can harm entrepreneurs' subjective well-being when they run a commercial venture. Embedded within a contingency perspective informed by self-determination theory, we build on longitudinal survey data to explain the effect of prosocial motivation on entrepreneurs' overall 
life satisfaction
. Our analysis demonstrates that prosocial motivation has a negative effect on entrepreneurs' 
life satisfaction
 due to increased levels of stress. However, our findings show that the negative effect of prosocial motivation dissipates when perceived 
autonomy
 at work is high compared to when it is low. Overall, our research raises questions on the role of prosocial motivation for entrepreneurs' subjective well-being and, in particular, discusses its potential “dark side” in the context of commercial entrepreneurship.
Executive summary
Can there be a “dark side” in helping others? If so, how can we better understand under what conditions it emerges? Entrepreneurship research conventionally presents prosocial motivation as a positive driver for social venture creation and entrepreneurs' well-being. However, we have little knowledge about the consequences of prosocial motivation when we move outside the social entrepreneurship context. When prosocially motivated entrepreneurs lead a commercial venture, they face the difficult task of balancing the desire to help others with the financial requirements of the business. The challenge of simultaneously accomplishing commercial and prosocial goals can result in a stressful experience that is detrimental to the entrepreneur's well-being. In this study, we ask whether and under what circumstances prosocial motivation can harm entrepreneurs' well-being.
Embedded in a contingency perspective informed by self-determination theory, this article expands our knowledge on the effects of prosocial motivation in the context of commercial entrepreneurship. We draw from original longitudinal survey data on 186 entrepreneurs in the United Kingdom to demonstrate that prosocial motivation causes entrepreneurs stress and through that stress has a negative effect on their life satisfaction. We also show that the negative effect of prosocial motivation diminishes when the degree of autonomy entrepreneurs perceive in the pursuit of daily work tasks is high. To explore the uniqueness of the entrepreneurial context, we run a comparative analysis with a sample of 544 employees. This analysis confirms that stress fully mediates the negative relationship between prosocial motivation and subjective well-being, but for employees, this negative effect disappears when their level of intrinsic motivation—the desire to expend effort based on enjoyment of the work itself—is high.
Building on our findings, we generate several important contributions. First, we help develop an understanding of the “dark side” of prosocial motivation by demonstrating that under certain circumstances, the desire to help others can be detrimental to entrepreneurs' subjective well-being. Second, we expand knowledge about the link between prosocial motivation and well-being by considering the boundary conditions (perceived autonomy and intrinsic motivation) that influence the dynamics of their relationship. Third, we set the stage for further investigations that aim to clarify the relationship between motivation and perceived autonomy and its effect on personal outcomes across different work domains.
The key insight of the study is that prosocial motivation creates a dilemma for entrepreneurs when operating a commercial business such that the desire to help others outside the context of immediate work tasks can harm their personal well-being. We also find that the perception of autonomy is key for commercial entrepreneurs to be able to realize their prosocial motivation without creating stressful situations. Extending our understanding of the conditions that shape the relationship between prosocial motivation and well-being among entrepreneurs would help in developing a more holistic notion of prosocial business venturing, one that includes the role of both commercial and social enterprising activities in contributing to personal and societal well-being.", July 2019,"Entrepreneurship, prosocial motivation, subjective well-being",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Researchers in entrepreneurial studies are increasingly interested in the psychological well-being of entrepreneurs. Approaches to well-being tend to be partitioned into hedonic and eudaimonic formulations. Most entrepreneurial studies have focused on hedonic indicators (life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect). The central objective of this essay is to examine the relevance of eudaimonic well-being for understanding 
entrepreneurial experience
. The theoretical background and key dimensions of eudaimonic well-being are described and their relevance for entrepreneurial studies is considered. Illustrative findings from prior well-being studies are examined, also with emphasis on possible extensions to entrepreneurship. Five key venues for the entrepreneurial field are then considered: (1) entrepreneurship and 
autonomy
, viewed both as a motive (self-determination theory) and as an aspect of well-being (eudaimonic well-being theory); (2) varieties of entrepreneurship (opportunity versus necessity) and eudaimonic well-being; (3) 
eudaimonia
 in the entrepreneurial journey (beginning, middle, end); (4) entrepreneurship, well-being and health; and (5) entrepreneurs and the 
eudaimonia
 of others – contrasting virtuous and vicious types. In each topic, extant findings from entrepreneurial studies are considered and new research directions proposed. The overall aim is to be generative regarding the interplay between 
entrepreneurial experience
 and eudaimonic well-being.
Executive summary
Although there is growing research on the psychological well-being of entrepreneurs, most studies to date have focused on hedonic conceptions of well-being. However, key aspects of eudaimonic well-being (e.g., realization of personal potential, purposeful life engagement, effective management of complex environments) have received little attention even though they may be particularly relevant to entrepreneurial pursuits. To address this issue, the theoretical foundation of a widely-used eudaimonic model is briefly described along with its empirical operationalization. Illustrative findings generated with this model are noted, and their relevance for entrepreneurial studies is considered. Shifting to extant entrepreneurial research, five topical venues are then presented, beginning with a call to better distinguish the meaning and measurement of 
autonomy
 (as a core motive from self-determination theory, and as an aspect of well-being from eudaimonic theory) in studies of entrepreneurial experience. The eudaimonic well-being of different types of entrepreneurs is then considered with a primary focus on the distinction between necessity versus opportunity entrepreneurs. These particular types invoke emphasis on 
sociodemographic factors
 (e.g., educational and occupational status, income, wealth) that are known from previous research to matter in accounting for differences in reported levels of well-being. The third venue considers how eudaimonic well-being may matter over the course of entrepreneurial experience, underscoring that certain aspects of well-being may account for who chooses an entrepreneurial path while other aspects may serve as protective resources (buffers) vis-à-vis the stresses attendant to managing a self-initiated business. Still other aspects of well-being may be nurtured by the longer-term journey of business venturing. The health of entrepreneurs is then considered as linked to experiences of well-being. New directions for objective 
health assessments
 (functional health, biomarkers, 
neuroscience
, gene expression) are considered; all have previously been linked in population-based studies to eudaimonic well-being. Finally, the impact of entrepreneurs on the lives of others (co-workers, employees, families, communities, society) is considered via the contrast between benevolent (virtuous) versus malevolent (vicious) entrepreneurs. Promising empirical questions that follow from these observations are detailed.
From a lay perspective, the central importance of bringing eudaimonia to the field of entrepreneurial studies is that the essential core of this type of well-being involves realization of personal talents and potential. Such active pursuit of such personal excellence, in the spirit of Aristotle, is fundamental to entrepreneurship.", July 2019,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Self-employment can be stressful and its long-term effects on individual health could be significant; yet, the physiological outcomes of self-employment related stress remain under-explored. Drawing on allostatic load as a long-term biological consequence of physiological wear-and-tear and an indicator of stress response, we use three different studies to provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between self-employment and physiological outcomes. In Study 1, based on a sample of 194 self-employed and 1511 employed individuals, we find that self-employment is marginally related to allostatic load and allostatic load marginally mediates the relationship between self-employment and physical, but not mental, health. Study 2, based on a sample of 776 self-employed and 8003 employed individuals, extends these findings, and provides evidence that those who are self-employed for longer periods have a higher allostatic load. Finally, in Study 3 we draw on a sample of 174 twins and, consistent with Study 2, show that those reporting self-employment in two waves (about eight years apart) had a higher allostatic load, however, when leveraging problem-focused coping such individuals experienced lower allostatic load.

In addition, we argue that the relevance of optimal distinctiveness varies with a venture's age and a category's density. We tested our hypotheses using data from 1668 metal bands that were founded in the United Kingdom between 1967 and 2005. The results indicate that optimal distinctiveness is relevant to new ventures' failure risk. Moreover, we show that venture age attenuates the relevance of optimal distinctiveness, whereas category density strengthens that factor's relevance.", May 2019,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Prior research describes international expansion as a series of discrete steps and notes that taking them threatens new ventures' survival, especially due to unexpected setbacks. Seen through the lens of social science, the source of such threat becomes clearer. In this paper, we argue that 
internationalization
 in new ventures involves what social anthropologists call a liminal transition – a betwixt-and-between period lying between the 
intent
 to internationalize and the realization of a stable internationalized state. The ambiguous and transitory nature of this liminal transition has the potential to increase the odds of overreach (e.g. a high-cost market entry without sufficient resources). Avoiding the negative influence of liminality – and instead harnessing its positive effect – relies on three sources of support that we refer to as opportunity scaffolding: self-reflective learning, 
peer learning
 and consultative learning. We argue that entrepreneurs with personality profiles high in levels of core self-evaluation (CSE) are more likely to utilize the scaffolding like that available in business incubators effectively. This leads to the development of a more reflective 
mindset
, making capability learning more likely, preventing decisions that lead to overreach and reducing the threat to INV survival. However we also strike a note of caution in that at excessive (hyper) levels of CSE, the internationalizing new venture could become the victim of hubris. Emboldened with unrealistically high self-confidence, hubristic entrepreneurs are more likely to rebuff use of scaffolding, leading to a more reactive 
mindset
, increasing the probability of liminal overreach and threatening INV survival.
Executive summary
Internationalization represents an important pathway to growth for new ventures. At the same time, the burden of 
internationalization
 is considerable since new ventures must learn new capabilities under severe resource constraints to succeed in international markets. Thus we have a tension: 
internationalization
 increases the odds of growing rapidly and lowers the odds of survival for new ventures. Therefore, it is important for new ventures' capability 
learning process
 to be effective through harnessing network ties and entrepreneurial cognition.
However, although we know a lot about what makes international new ventures (INVs) successful, there is a surprising lack of detailed understanding of the 
transition
 that these firms make during the 
internationalization
 process. 
Becoming
 a stable INV involves making sense of new environments and improvising in the face of unexpected setbacks. Previous work has focused more on how INVs fare while pursuing identified opportunities during initial or post-entry internationalization but not as much on how they cope in the transition to becoming a stable INV over time.
To address this deficiency we draw upon an underutilized theoretical lens from 
social anthropology
: liminality. Liminality describes the “betwixt-and-between” condition that is experienced during a transition when one is no longer in the original state but hasn't quite reached the new one. This perspective draws attention to both a vulnerability and an opportunity that are simultaneously heightened during transitions: the novelty of the situation can be cognitively confounding and liberating. If a new venture's entrepreneur is overwhelmed by distorted thinking during this liminal period, he or she may lead the INV to take fatal missteps, including overreaching. On the other hand, if the confusion inherent in this process can be contained and the potential creativity of this stage harnessed, then new capabilities can be learned and the potentially treacherous liminal period successfully navigated. Thus liminality theory helps to distinguish between measured and reckless improvisation.
Liminal theory also helps us to identify opportunity scaffolding as an important way of avoiding liminality's negative effects by facilitating reflective learning, 
peer learning
 and consultative learning in conjunction with mentors. A practical manifestation of such support is the use of business incubators. Where these are not available, entrepreneurs may avail of mentors and peers through other means such as advisory boards or education. Furthermore, entrepreneurial personality in influences entrepreneurs' propensity for using such scaffolding: those with high levels of core self-evaluation (CSE) – confident of their abilities – are more likely to use scaffolding whereas those with low or excessive levels of CSE will tend to rebuff the use of scaffolding.
Overall, our conceptualization complements previous work on capability learning with the notion of “transitioning capability” – which is the ability to harness the creativity of liminality while avoiding its confounding potential. This is a theoretical advance over how INV research views the capability 
learning process
. And it has strong practical implications for how international entrepreneurs can thoughtfully navigate liminality, by taking advantage of opportunity scaffolding, being self-aware of limitations and strengths and avoiding overreach.", May 2019,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Experimental methods
 provide important advantages for advancing academic understanding of entrepreneurship. Yet, the complex and comingled relationships between some of entrepreneurship's key characteristics pose thorny methodological challenges to entrepreneurship researchers – notably to negotiate important tradeoffs between the ideals of external and 
construct validity
. To facilitate the sound mobilization of experimental methods in entrepreneurship research, we present an overview of critical validity challenges plaguing entrepreneurship research experiments and assess the validation practices mobilized in 144 studies using such methods. Building on these findings, we develop a practical guide of actionable validation strategies to help experimenters navigate the above tradeoffs and conduct entrepreneurship research experiments that are realistic, theoretically meaningful, and that help establish the causal effects of their focal variables. By doing so, we contribute a set of pragmatic means to support the mobilization of experimental methods for advancing entrepreneurship research.
Executive summary
Experimental methods
 hold important advantages for advancing the theoretical and practical understanding of 
entrepreneurial action
. The power of research experiments lies in their ability to yield convincing evidence supporting the causal effects of the factors they investigate.
Unfortunately, entrepreneurship research experiments are often criticized for offering pale copies of 
both
 the realities they attempt to model 
and
 the theoretical constructs they aim to study. The entrepreneurial process and its related activities count many intertwined characteristics – such as radical uncertainty, temporal dynamics, high personal stakes and other constraints – that can prove difficult to integrate in experimental studies. Moreover, these characteristics' comingled relationships raise important tensions with experimental methods' core principle of surgically focusing on the causal effects of a few manipulated variables. As a result, entrepreneurship research must overcome a number of validity challenges and tradeoffs in order to successfully leverage experimental methods and offer findings that convincingly support the causality of their theoretical developments.
Compounding these difficulties, the guidance typically offered in research methods textbooks tends to focus on generic issues that are altogether separate from the specific challenges of conducting valid entrepreneurship research experiments. Because of this, many research manuscripts mobilizing experimental methods arrive at the review process with important shortcomings. This threatens the field's knowledge accumulation and typically calls for authors to refine their work and collect additional data.
To help researchers face these challenges, we offer a three-part compendium focused on bolstering the validity of entrepreneurship research experiments. First, we complement the generic observations of research methods 
monographs
 by presenting an overview of the validity tradeoffs inherent to mobilizing experimental methods in entrepreneurship research – and of strategies for addressing these.
Second, and to demonstrate that overcoming these challenges is not a trivial task, we conduct a structured literature review of the external and construct validation strategies deployed in a comprehensive corpus of 144 relevant articles published in both entrepreneurship-focused journals and broader generalist journals from the applied behavioral and social sciences. Among the most positive elements emerging from our analyses, we note upward trends in the mobilization of pilot tests, in the conduct of multiple experiments within single papers as well as in the use of parallel studies using different data collection methods. We also observe increased efforts to explain the practical relevance of experimental findings. To our surprise, however, our analyses uncover downward trends in the mobilization of pre-tests to examine the research material's external validity and representativeness, as well as the continued publication of studies that do not report empirical evidence regarding their focal manipulations' 
construct validity
. This is concerning. Such practices undermine these experiments' abilities to yield convincing evidence in support of their theorized causal effects – and for what these imply for fostering 
entrepreneurial action
.
Third, and in light of the results obtained, we develop a practical guide of actionable strategies for navigating the validity tradeoffs of entrepreneurship research experiments. Grouping these strategies together allows us to systematize recommendations typically found across various methods 
monographs
, thereby offering an overall scheme to help entrepreneurship researchers navigate the validity tradeoffs inherent to conducting realistic and theoretically meaningful experiments. To make our recommendations as actionable as possible, we develop an extensive step-by-step guide of design and assessment strategies relevant to entrepreneurship research experiments. The guide spans the entire research process – from conceiving an experimental study to collecting, analyzing and reporting the results. The guide also includes a number of relevant exemplars from many different studies we analyzed.
By discussing these entrepreneurship-specific validity tradeoffs and combining that with an overview of strategies for addressing them, our study offers an entrepreneurship-centered synthesis that equips entrepreneurship researchers with the necessary tools for conducting experimental research that advances understanding of the causal effects supporting entrepreneurial action and its related phenomena.", March 2019,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

In an initial coin offering (ICO), new ventures raise capital by selling tokens to a crowd of investors. Often, this token is a

This initial study therefore assesses the determinants of the amount raised in 423 ICOs. Drawing on signaling theory, the study explores the role of signaling ventures' technological capabilities in ICOs. The results show that technical white papers and high-quality source codes increase the amount raised, while patents are not associated with increased amounts of funding. Exploring further determinants of the amount raised, the results indicate that some of the underlying mechanisms in ICOs resemble those found in prior research into entrepreneurial

Start-ups have a high need for resources yet 
face
 significant risks when forming partnerships with incumbents to access those resources. We propose that a partnership strategy based on relational 
pluralism
, forming multiplex and multifaceted ties with partners, can mitigate these risks. Such ties offer the start-up increased legitimacy and a relational safeguard against resource misappropriation by more powerful partners. However, we propose that there is a limit to the effectiveness of relational 
pluralism
. Its effect is weakened when the start-up becomes entirely dependent on a small set of partners, or when an additional tie yields resources that are redundant. We argue that the start-up only benefits when the gains from relational safeguarding and legitimacy outweigh the costs of dependence and redundancy. We empirically observe the co-evolution of start-ups’ interlocking directorate and strategic alliance networks in the Australian mining industry over a 10-year period. Our results show that start-ups that engage in relational pluralism perform better than both start-ups that form no alliances and start-ups that form stand-alone alliances. Having a very small portfolio of partners or one that skews heavily toward local partners, however, indeed limits the effectiveness of relational pluralism. Intriguingly, we also find that the temporal sequencing of relational pluralism matters. One of our central findings is that the best performing start-ups first form board interlocks with promising partners and add a strategic alliance later.

We consider the influence of inter- and intra-individual team dynamics on entrepreneurial passion change and the relevance of passion change to important outcomes. Drawing on person-environment fit theory, we hypothesize first, that in newly formed teams, the entrepreneurial passion levels of individuals are impacted by their peers' passion (the average passion of their teammates). Second, we expect that individuals' trajectories of passion change are influenced by their perception of fit with the team. Third, passion levels and trajectories are expected to impact entrepreneurial outcomes for both individuals and teams. To examine these temporal dynamics, our hypotheses are tested with data from an accelerator program involving 343 team members nested in 79 newly formed teams. The findings reveal that in new teams, individuals' passion for inventing, founding, and developing are positively (negatively) influenced when teammates have higher (lower) passion for these roles and the association between individual's passion and peers' aggregated passion becomes stronger over time. Over time, positive passion trajectories emerge when an individual perceives higher fit with their team, and entrepreneurial 
intent
 is predicted by both (a) end-state levels of individual passion and (b) passion trajectories for inventing and founding (but not developing). Finally, we find that team passion trajectories predict team performance.

While an economic paradigm has been productive for entrepreneurship, religion has been proposed as an alternative rationality to advance research in our field. To extend a theological turn in entrepreneurship and identity research, our study inductively develops a conceptual model that explains how individuals navigate entrepreneurial identity threats based on the interaction between a relational identity with God (RIG) and an entrepreneurial identity to persist in 
entrepreneurial action
. Our study suggests this can happen when entrepreneurs engage in inter-identity work mechanisms - affirming and humbling - to mitigate these identity threats. Specifically, a relational identity with God acts as a countervailing force to an entrepreneurial identity during times of identity threats to generate inter-identity meaning change, resulting in interidentity stability and entrepreneurial persistence. Through our study, we advance knowledge on the theological turn in entrepreneurship and identity by inductively developing theory on a new religious identity construct (RIG), elaborating theory of inter-identity work by shifting the focus from structural to content changes, and extending theory on entrepreneurial action, persistence, and well-being based on theological rather than economic considerations.", July 2023,"Identity work, Inter-identity work, Entrepreneurial identity, Relational identity, Mental health, Well-being, Religion, Entrepreneurial action, Entrepreneurial persistence, Success, Failure, Theological turn",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

In his seminal contribution, 
Baumol (1990)
 proposes that the direction of entrepreneurial effort towards its productive (e.g., start-up activity) or unproductive (e.g., rent-seeking) use in a society depends on institutions or the “rules of the game”. We focus on an important micro-foundation of Baumol's theory namely that certain individuals change the direction of entrepreneurial efforts with institutional change. Our research contrasts with previous work on the role of institutions, which mostly focuses on the aggregate macro-level, while not observing individual behavior. We analyze who decides to start a venture in East Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall and find that many individuals who demonstrated commitment to the anti-entrepreneurial 
communist regime
 in the GDR were active in launching new ventures soon after German re-unification. We argue that commitment to 
communism
 among post-communist entrepreneurs reflects rent-seeking. Once institutions change radically, entrepreneurial efforts are directed towards start-up activity. We rely on the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) that includes information on whether East German respondents had a telephone before German re-unification, which was one of the most sought-after rewards for commitment to the regime. We find that telephone owners had a higher propensity of becoming successful firm founders. Telephone owners were also more likely to have an entrepreneurship-prone personality profile and value orientation. Our results confirm Baumol's theory and suggest that alertness to entrepreneurial arbitrage opportunities is guiding the redirection of entrepreneurial effort in the face of drastic institutional change.
Executive summary
There is a large body of literature on the effect of institutions on entrepreneurship. A good share of this literature is rooted in the seminal contribution by 
Baumol (1990)
 who argues that the shape of institutions determines whether people direct entrepreneurial effort to productive, unproductive or destructive 
entrepreneurial activities
. Despite the fact that Baumol‘s main argument is at the individual micro-level, most of the literature focuses only on the macro-level implications of his theory. In contrast to most previous studies, we are not focusing on the aggregate level of entrepreneurship but explore the micro-foundations of Baumol's theory and analyze how (drastic) institutional change affects the entrepreneurial choice at the individual level.
In our discussion of Baumol's work, we also introduce Kirzner's concept of individual alertness to arbitrage opportunities which he originally formulated for market economies. We extend Kirzner's insights on the role of alertness to other institutional contexts (e.g., socialism) and forms of arbitrage (e.g., engagement in socialist organizations) other than start-up activity, and highlight the role of institutional change in shaping processes of opportunity formation.
It is important to understand how individuals allocate their entrepreneurial effort in times of major historical shocks and institutional changes for several reasons. First, since entrepreneurship is an important driver of economic growth and development, it is crucial to understand how institutional change affects entrepreneurial behavior at the individual level for designing policy measures targeted at increasing the entrepreneurial propensity of people. Second, the share of people with an entrepreneurial talent in a society is an enormous resource to cope with socio-economic change. Third, it is also important to understand the micro-foundations of Baumol's work as vast empirical evidence on the impact of institutions on entrepreneurial activities that is available at the macro-level relies on the validity of the micro-foundations.
We find that people who demonstrated commitment to one of the most anti-entrepreneurial institutional regimes in history—communism—were more likely to start a firm after transition to a market economy. Our analysis is based on the case of East Germany that saw a sudden shift from an anti-entrepreneurial communist regime that did not reward start-up activities towards an entrepreneurship-facilitating market economy after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Those people who were actively committed to the regime as evidenced by material rewards obtained in the GDR were more likely to become (successful) self-employed after the fall of the Berlin Wall. We also observe that people with an entrepreneurship-prone personality profile and those who put a strong emphasis on entrepreneurial values were more likely to have obtained material rewards in communism that indicate a strong commitment to the system.
We argue that applying and extending Baumol's and also Kirzner's ideas helps understanding this puzzling phenomenon. In essence, regime commitment can be seen as a form of rent-seeking activity, which is a classic example of unproductive entrepreneurial activity discussed by Baumol. Rent-seeking in the context of communism could be expressed, for example, in enthusiastic engagement in public organizations (e.g., party councils, youth organizations, state-owned enterprises) in exchange for specific material rewards. Their pronounced alertness to new arbitrage opportunities may have enabled these same individuals to switch to start-up activity once this option became available to them and if it was more profitable than rent-seeking.
We contribute to the literature by supporting the idea that the institutional framework conditions determine the type of entrepreneurial activity to which entrepreneurially talented people devote their efforts. So far, this claim found support mainly in aggregated macro-level data. Another important insight from our analysis is that entrepreneurs are flexible and agile economic agents who are alert to arbitrage opportunities and able to promptly adapt themselves to even radical changes, such as the 
shock transition
 from a socialist command economy to a market economy. Alertness to opportunities in a market economy context could hardly be learned in an anti-entrepreneurial context. Hence, an immediate re-allocation of entrepreneurial efforts indicates that alertness to arbitrage opportunities emerging in a market economy does not necessarily require experience in a market economy context.
Our assessment also suggests that institutional change is shaping subjective processes of opportunity formation. Hence, the debate on whether opportunities are ‘out there’ or they have to be created should take into consideration how institutions and institutional change set the boundaries for opportunities. In particular, identifying and pursuing new opportunities brought about by institutional change could represent a specific form of “entrepreneurship talent.”", September 2022,"L26, P20, P31",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Executive summary
Artificial intelligence
 (AI) 
refers to machines that are trained to perform tasks associated with 
human intelligence
, interpret external data, learn from that external data, and use that learning to flexibly adapt to tasks to achieve specific outcomes
. 
Machine learning
 is the most common form of AI and largely relies on supervised learning—when the machine (i.e., AI) is trained with labels applied by humans. 
Deep learning
 and 
adversarial learning
 involve training on unlabeled data, or when the machine (via its algorithms) clusters data to reveal underlying patterns.
AI is simply a tool. Entrepreneurship is also simply a tool. How they are combined and used will determine their impact on humanity. While researchers have independently developed a greater understanding of entrepreneurship and AI, these two streams of research have primarily run in parallel. To indicate the scope of current and future AI, we provide examples of AI (at different levels of development) for four sectors—customer service, financial, healthcare, and tertiary education. Indeed, experts from 
industry
 research and consulting firms suggest many AI-related business opportunities for entrepreneurs to pursue.
Further, we elaborate on several of these opportunities, including opportunities to (1) capitalize on the “feeling economy,” (2) redistribute occupational skills in the economy, (3) develop and use new governance mechanisms, (4) keep humans in the loop (i.e., humans as part of the 
decision making
 process), (5) expand the role of humans in developing AI systems, and (6) expand the purposes of AI as a tool. After discussing the range of business opportunities that experts suggest will prevail in the economy with AI, we discuss how entrepreneurs can use AI as a tool to help them increase their chances of entrepreneurial success. We focus on four up-and-coming areas for entrepreneurship research: a more interaction-based perspective of (potential) entrepreneurial opportunities, a more activities-based micro-foundation approach to 
entrepreneurial action
, a more cognitively hot perspective of entrepreneurial 
decision making
 and action, and a more compassionate and prosocial role of 
entrepreneurial action
. As we discuss each topic, we also suggest opportunities to design an AI system (i.e., entrepreneurs as potential AI designers) to help entrepreneurs (i.e., entrepreneurs as AI users).
AI is an exciting development in the technology world. How it transforms markets and societies depends in large part on entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs can use AI to augment their decisions and actions in pursuing potential opportunities for productive gains. Thus, we discuss entrepreneurs' most critical tasks in developing and managing AI and explore some of the dark-side aspects of AI. Scholars also have a role to play in how entrepreneurs use AI, but this role requires the hard work of 
theory building
, theory elaboration, theory testing, and empirical theorizing. We offer some AI topics that we hope future entrepreneurship research will explore. We hope this paper encourages scholars to consider research at the nexus of AI and entrepreneurship.", July 2022,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Using a population wide sample of 114,837 spawns founded in Sweden between 2000 and 2007, we find that nonfamily member spawns survive longer than spawns from nonfamily firms, and that this survival enhancing effect is contingent on the spatial and social proximity between the spawn and its parent. We also find that spawns founded by family members, on average, do not survive longer than spawns from family firms founded by nonfamily members, and that greater spatial and cognitive distance even hurt the survival of family member spawns.

Entrepreneurs regularly confront resource constraints as they attempt to bring their ideas to fruition. To overcome resource constraints, they often try to mobilize resources from external resource providers and use 
narratives
 as a critical tool to do so. We theorize that a particular type of narrative – a resourcefulness narrative – will significantly impact an entrepreneur's ability to mobilize support from resource providers. A resourcefulness narrative is a discursive, temporal account of past or ongoing 
entrepreneurial actions
, whereby an entrepreneur is presented as using, assembling, or deploying resources in creative ways in order to overcome an impediment. We argue that a resourcefulness narrative generates positive emotional and cognitive reactions from external resource providers such that they are inclined to support a venture. Furthermore, these effects are contingent on the general level of resource scarcity or 
munificence
 in a venture's environment, the level of uncertainty underpinning the venture, the entrepreneur's experience, and the recency of the actions described within the narrative. By acting resourcefully and transforming that action into a narrative, entrepreneurs can resourcefully mobilize support.", July 2021,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Paradox theory is attracting increasing interest from entrepreneurship scholars seeking to understand how entrepreneurs who operate hybrid organizations such as prosocial ventures can effectively address grand challenges. The organizational paradox literature suggests that differences in actors' approach to paradoxes can occur through the acquisition of different reasoning styles through exposure to different national cultures and cultural resources. We complement the paradox research stream on culture as a resource with the alternative perspective of culture as an experience, which we argue offers additional insight into hybridity within a global context because intercultural experiences are intrinsically paradoxical. Our 18 case studies of immigrant entrepreneurs from the African diaspora operating their prosocial ventures in Western contexts finds that the ways that immigrant entrepreneurs approach tensions in their prosocial ventures mirrors the nature of their intercultural experience. We also find that approaches to paradox vary based on structural barriers such as social exclusion that entrepreneurs faced in their formative years. Overall, our study contributes to research on culture in paradox theory and the prosocial venturing literature by elucidating how entrepreneurs' intercultural experience and the global macro-level systems in which it is embedded inform the degree and configurations of hybridity in prosocial ventures.", May 2021,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

The market for secondary venture 
capital transactions
 provides a way for investors to obtain liquidity if the investee start-up corporation has not yet reached sufficient maturity for an IPO. It also creates 
divestment
 opportunities for badly performing ventures that investors would rather abandon. We analyze the way in which the opportunistic behavior and 
liquidity constraints
 of venture capital funds channel deal flow into the secondary venture capital market. Such opportunistic behavior leads to the 
strategic exit
 of seed financing venture capitalists. These exits enlarge investors' opportunity set of strategies and therefore affect the deal terms with entrepreneurs. In this paper, we show that two contracts are possible in a world with financially constrained venture capital investors, staged investments, and premature 
divestment
 opportunities. Both contracts have their disadvantages. With the first, the venture capitalist will never liquidate a project, even if it is a lemon, but will instead engage in a secondary transaction. With the second contract, although lemons will be systematically abandoned, high-quality ventures may also be liquidated. Entrepreneurs need to consider these effects when aiming to maximize their benefits and must 
trade off
 the contract parameters accordingly. Our model provides guidance to entrepreneurs in this respect, helps to explain deal flow into the secondary venture capital market, and offers several empirical predictions.", March 2021,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Prior research on entrepreneurial visions has typically taken a leadership perspective and explored how the founders’ future images of their ventures motivate themselves and followers. Drawing on an upper echelon perspective and longitudinal case studies of eight founding teams, this study finds that founders’ entrepreneurial visions do not only capture the future images of their ventures, but also the future images of the founders’ relationship with it. Taking into account this personal aspect of visions, we show that within a founding team, the members’ visions can be incongruent, i.e., they cannot be realized simultaneously within the current venture. While our data reveal that vision incongruence tends to occurs when all team members perceive to have an equal status, vision congruence emerges when the attributed status in the team is heterogeneous. Founding teams with more congruent visions tend to follow a focused opportunity development path, while those with less congruent visions tend to follow a comprehensive opportunity development path. Depending on the teams’ behaviors in the face of challenging situations either path can lead to successful opportunity commercialization or failure. We discuss the implications of these findings for the literatures on entrepreneurial visions, opportunities, and upper echelons.", March 2020,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

We examine the process of organizational 
image formation
 for new ventures entering an emerging organizational category. An emerging organizational category is usually initiated by a pioneering venture that adopts a new organizational form. If that venture garners early recognition, it serves as an exemplar, attracting other ventures to enter the emerging category. Those ventures then have to formulate an image that both accounts for and competes with that of the category exemplar. This article describes how ventures form their images in the face of this tension. We examine this tension using qualitative data from eight new U.S. venture accelerators entering the emergent venture accelerator category, which revealed that 
image formation
 in an emerging organizational category involves three basic considerations: (1) emulation, (2) experimentation, and (3) divergence. Through emulation, organizations observe and rely on the exemplar in order to capture legitimacy. Through experimentation, organizations consider who they are beyond the exemplar and how they might change. Through divergence, organizations definitively claim and establish a unique image. From this, a conceptual framework is proposed in which organizational and contextual factors influence image formation actions and decisions.", January 2020,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

This paper formalizes and estimates the process of 
search and matching
 between entrepreneurs and financiers in the 
business angel
 (BA) market. Our theoretical model describes the market for entrepreneurial 
finance
 as a fair in which the two sides of the market can meet bilaterally and transform a rough entrepreneurial idea into a real start-up firm. We then collect a new dataset from the BA markets of 17 developed countries for the period 1996–2014, and we estimate the aggregate matching function expressing the number of deals as a function of the number of submitted entrepreneurial projects and of business angels. Empirical findings confirm the technological features assumed in the theoretical literature: positive and decreasing marginal returns to both inputs (
stepping on toes
 effect), technological complementarity across the two inputs (
thick market
 effect) and constant returns to scale. We discuss the theoretical and policy implications of these findings.", September 2019,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

When founding and managing a new business, entrepreneurs are frequently confronted with stressors hampering their daily work. The present study examines how these entrepreneurial stressors affect two important interrelated indicators of entrepreneurs' recovery and well-being—that is, their ability to detach from work during non-work times (work-home interference) and their sleep (insomnia). We introduce prior entrepreneurial experience as an important moderator to these relationships, arguing that due to their different learning and coping experiences and their different interpretations of the entrepreneurial role, experienced versus novice entrepreneurs would react differently to entrepreneurial stressors. In an empirical study with 122 entrepreneurs, we found that among experienced entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial stressors primarily had a direct sleep-impairing effect. Among novice entrepreneurs, the same stressors primarily initiated an indirect effect by leading to increased work-home interference and consequently also increased insomnia. Overall, thus, our study shows that both novice and experienced entrepreneurs suffer from insomnia when encountering entrepreneurial stressors—however, the underlying mechanisms differ. Implications are discussed in terms of both theory and practice.", July 2019,"Stressors, Entrepreneurial experience, Recovery, Insomnia, Work-home interference",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Cognitive heuristics, biases, and 
overconfidence
 have been suggested as an explanation for entrepreneurial entry. Nevertheless, empirical research on the subject has produced mixed findings and has under-explored the cognitive mechanisms leading to 
overconfidence
 in entrepreneurial settings. In two within-subject experiments, we focus on three cognitive heuristics—reference point framing, outcome salience framing, and anchoring in conjunctive events—and examine their effects on perceived risk, confidence, required and estimated probabilities of success, and the decision to start a new venture. Our findings show that reference point framing and outcome salience framing affect the decision to enter directly and indirectly via risk perception, but do not affect confidence. In addition, the effect of anchoring is contingent on the congruence between its semantic and its numeric influences. Overconfidence only obtains when the numeric and semantic influences of anchoring are aligned and aimed at enhancing the salience of potential positive outcomes, i.e., through high probabilities of success.", May 2019,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

Neural correlates of entrepreneurial and parental bonding,"Tom=Lahti: tom.lahti@hanken.fi, Marja-Liisa=Halko: Not Found, Necmi=Karagozoglu: Not Found, Joakim=Wincent: Not Found","Abstract
This paper investigates why and how founding entrepreneurs bond with their ventures. We develop and test theory about the nature of bonding in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of 42 subjects (21 entrepreneurs and 21 parents). We find that entrepreneurs and parents show similar signs of affective bonding, that self-confidence plays a role in bonding style, and that the degree to which entrepreneurs include their ventures in the self and to which parents include their child in the self influences their ability to make critical assessments. Our findings suggest that bonding is similar for entrepreneurs and parents and that venture stimuli influence reward systems, self-regulatory functions, and mental factors that are associated with judgment.", March 2019,"Bonding, fMRI, Entrepreneurship, Parenting, Self-confidence, Bonding style, Judgment, Neuropsychology",Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025

This paper studies the combined effect of affiliation with prestigious universities, underwriters, and venture capitalists on the valuation of biotech ventures at IPO and their post-IPO performance. We argue that affiliation to a prestigious university provides the affiliated firm with a quality signal in the scientific domain. The pure quality signaling effect of the affiliation is isolated from the substantive benefits it provides by performing a difference-in-difference approach based on the scientific reputation of scientists in firms' upper echelons. The signal is stronger the weaker is the scientific reputation of scientists of the focal IPO-firm and is additive to those provided by prestigious venture capitalists and underwriters. Results for a sample of 254 European biotech ventures that went through an IPO between 1990 and 2009 confirm our predictions.", January 2019,Not Found,Business Venturing,04 Mar 2025
